    I am a certified and experienced registered yoga teacher in Tucson, Ariz.


I teach Hatha/alignment-based public (and private) yoga classes (and indoor cycling classes) in Tucson unless otherwise noted below.

I teach to all levels, whether you are a beginner, recovering from an injury, needing a slower pace with strong alignment cues, gentle adjustments and some humor I&#8217;m the yoga teacher for you.

All levels are supported and welcome.

All students are welcome in my classes. All students are loved. All students are safe.

**Spring Restorative Yoga**  
<a href="http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/restorative-yoga-ws/" rel="attachment wp-att-16313"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-16313" src="http://gofitgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restorative-yoga-WS-300x174.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="174" /></a>Saturday, March 30 from 3-5 p.m. by Ann Chihak Poff

Entering spring offers us the opportunity to look at life with a fresh look.

As nature cycles from the season of winter — a time to be inward — to spring — a time to grow and renew — this Restorative workshop helps us to celebrate this new season that is upon us.

This two-hour workshop will be relaxing and rejuvenating.

The poses you practice will help to bring your physical body to feel ease and comfort and give it the opportunity to come back to balance while also creating and supporting calm and quiet for the mind and breath.

Cost: $15 for members/$20 for non-members. After 3/25 $25 for all students.
