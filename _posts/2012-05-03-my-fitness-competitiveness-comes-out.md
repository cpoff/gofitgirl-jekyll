    There is a lot of "lunge" work in yoga. Here I am showing the Crescent Lunge also known as High Lunge.

Sorry that I have been a little absent lately. Work has been nuts. Tuesday and Wednesday I had to come home and do a little work. So really by the time I was done with that I had no interest in blogging. Let&#8217;s just say I am glad this week is almost over. I am exhausted.  
OK, now on to the real post &#8230;  
I am not typically a competitive person (except when it comes to playing the [game Taboo](http://www.hasbro.com/games/en_US/shop/details.cfm?R=AD4902E9-5056-900B-1073-EAB639BF818E:en_US)) and apparently when it comes to the wellness program at work and the ongoing and multiple challenges we have going on.  
I am involved in many fitness challenges at the moment.  
First the century mile: I have already hit and far exceeded the 100-mile goal. My personal goal is to hit 500 miles by the end date of the challenge. After spinning today I am now at 414 miles with a little more than a week to go.  
Second is climb the stairs. The goal to reach each week is to walk the stairs for 25 minutes a week. Another challenge is to add 10 minutes to your exercise three times a week. Originally I didn&#8217;t accept this challenge since I already exercise between and hour and two hours each time I hit the gym or yoga studio and adding any more time seemed insane and not practical. But I figured I could combine the stairs and extra 10 minutes challenge into one, which I did this week.  
I am also involved in a challenge through Facebook. This week the challenge is to do 1,000 lunges and squats in a week. (A couple of weeks ago I participated in the [1,000 crunches fitness challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9283) in a week.)  
So on Tuesday I put on my tennis shoes and took a 10-minute break and headed to the stairs. I combined three challenges all at once: 10 minutes on the stairs hit two of the challenges. I also threw in 90 lunges three different times coming back up the stairs.  
On Tuesday night my butt, thighs and hips ached. Take me away Aleve. When I woke up Wednesday my calves were super sore. I went on a 2-mile walk with some co-workers at noon on Wednesday. It was a great time to get away, get some exercise and stretch out my sore muscles. I had to work late Wednesday so I missed yoga, which was probably a good break for the calves.  
When I woke up this morning only my left calf was sore and it still is. I did a little stair climbing today&#8211;but not as much as I wanted. I did ride the spin bike today for 17 miles. I focused on endurance training, which seemed to not be so painful on the sore calf. Then I did 150 squats and no lunges.  
For my challenges this week: 414 miles (86 to go); 15 minutes on the stairs (10 minutes to go); I have hit the adding 10 minutes of extra exercise 3 times this week; and last I am at 350 squats/lunges&#8211;650 to go. (Also, many of these challenges are earning me points&#8211;which will win me prizes&#8211;through the wellness program at work.)
