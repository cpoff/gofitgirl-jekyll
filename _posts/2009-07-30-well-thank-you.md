So today before spin class started another regular came up to me and asked if [my shoes were cycling shoes](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3053). I got all of kinds of compliments after that. They are pretty comfy and don&#8217;t really look like cycling shoes. You can ride your bike with them and then go for a hike. (Not that I do either one of those.)  
So right now I am at 2 & 2: 2 yoga classes this week and 2 spin classes.
