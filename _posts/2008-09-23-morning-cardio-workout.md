I have a lunch date with my friend Mia today. So I will be missing my regular yoga class at 1 p.m. I didn&#8217;t want to workout after work because I have stuff to do. So I went this morning. And no, I did not take sunrise spin. I took that class once and I don&#8217;t think I will ever take it again.  
I did the elliptical for about 45 minutes while listening to my iPod and reading trashy celebrity news. Anna&#8217;s Nicole daughter recently turned 2. And that father of hers is going to make her a spoiled brat. But I digress.  
Anyway, glad I have my workout in already. And on to a day of work.
