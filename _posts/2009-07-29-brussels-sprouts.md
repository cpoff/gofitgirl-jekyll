So I cooked Brussels sprouts for the first time tonight.  
I love that I can just look online for ways to cook things. I, of course, refused to follow any instructions which referred to the veggie as Brussel sprouts&#8211;as that in incorrect. It is plural!  
Anyway, I am having my Brussels Sprouts and brown rice right now as I type this. I added a little olive oil with some Kickin&#8217; Chicken seasoning and salt and ground pepper. Not bad.  
I am not too picky when it comes to veggies. There are few I won&#8217;t eat or won&#8217;t try. I think this may be the first time I am having Brussels Sprouts.  
Today for lunch my work team went out to celebrate the newest permanent member of our team. I looked at the menu ahead of time to get some ideas. But [Skates](http://skatesonthebay.com) always has specials&#8211;usually different kinds of fish, which is what I figured I would have. I had water to drink; a taste of a few appetizers; I ordered grilled rainbow trout with no oil, which came with fingerling potatoes in a little olive oil and a tomato/olive mix; for dessert I had a non-fat cappuccino and sorbet; I also had a few sips of a Mojito. Some of my fellow co-workers are lightweights and need help in the booze department. I am always happy to help, along with another co-worker.
