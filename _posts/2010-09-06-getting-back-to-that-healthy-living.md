I have known for some time that I needed to lose some weight. I could feel the pounds returning even though I refused to verify it by stepping on the scale. There are a few pairs of pants that are very difficult to get up over my butt and hips. I am starting to feel yuck. So today I got on the scale to see what the damage was &#8230; 9 pounds. I am 9 pounds over my goal weight. That&#8217;s sort of a lot.  
I decided that something must be done about it and it must happen now. If I continue to let it go eventually 9 pounds will be 15, then 20 and eventually I will be back at where I started about four years ago when I first started losing weight.  
OK, here are my little rants &#8230;  
When I was losing weight people told me I had lost enough weight and didn&#8217;t need to lose anymore. Between my doctor and my Weight Watchers leader we had decided what was a safe weight for me to achieve and I did. Why do people think it is OK to comment on your weight when you are thin, skinny, losing weight, etc.? But I can&#8217;t tell someone they are a fat pig and should stop stuffing their face? Because that is rude, right? &#8230;  
People tell me it is OK to eat or drink whatever I want because I am on vacation, out of town, visiting Grandma, been so good lately, etc. No offense. But I don&#8217;t need anyone else helping me out in that department. I do just fine on my own.  
People making comments about what I am eating, what I am not eating, what I am ordering, etc. Let&#8217;s make a deal &#8230; I won&#8217;t comment about what you put in your mouth if you don&#8217;t comment on what I put in mine.  
Food pushers &#8230;  
If you want to support me in my healthy lifestyle (and quest to get back to my goal weight) I welcome it. If you don&#8217;t, then don&#8217;t, but keep that to yourself. Thanks &#8230;
