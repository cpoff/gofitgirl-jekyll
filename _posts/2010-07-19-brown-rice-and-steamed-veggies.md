I bought a rice cooker at Target yesterday. I have been wanting one for some time now. I like to make a &#8220;big&#8221; batch= about 2 cups&#8211;of brown rice at the beginning of the week since it takes some time to make. I use the rice throughout the week with various meals, veggie stir fry, steamed veggies, etc.  
The rice cooker I got also has a tray to steam veggies. So while my rice was cooking I steamed Brussels sprouts, broccoli and mushrooms. The rice cooked a little quicker than the pamphlet said so my veggies weren&#8217;t as soft as I would have liked. But they were still good.  
I mixed the rice and veggies with a little salt, pepper and a lot of Kickin&#8217; Chicken. It was a good, healthy and filling meal.
