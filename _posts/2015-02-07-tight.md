    During my yoga teacher training we had a long-term anatomy project where we had to pick three poses we found challenging but were able to do. We had our partners take pictures at all angles. For the assignment I purposely picked tight clothing so I could observe my body more easily.

Last month a woman [wrote a blog post](http://veronicapartridge.com/why-i-chose-to-no-longer-wear-leggings/#disqus_thread) about why she decided to stop wearing tight yoga pants in public, which [Yoganonymous reposted](http://yoganonymous.com/comfortable-or-evil-are-yoga-pants-enticing-men).  
Now she has clearly stated that this is just about herself and she is not telling anyone else that they shouldn&#8217;t wear tight yoga pants in public.  
During a conversation with her friends they talked about &#8220;leggings and how when women wear them it creates a stronger attraction for a man to look at a woman’s body and may cause them to think lustful thoughts.&#8221;  
Yes, tight yoga pants can entice men. But so can a woman&#8217;s voice. And a woman&#8217;s laugh. Her boots. Her glasses. Should we stop speaking, laughing, wearing shoes, seeing &#8230;  
Yes, all of my yoga pants are tight. They were designed that way. And I believe the main reason was so you can see your body. It enables you to be able to check appropriate alignment of yourself. Knees are a big concern and must be in proper alignment so you don&#8217;t hurt yourself.  
Tight pants also helps your teacher be able to easily check your alignment and make sure you are safe in poses.  
(There was even one day in a yoga class that I had a long-sleeve shirt on and my teacher moved the sleeve so she could check the alignment of my wrist.)  
I remember in high school while taking ballet the teacher mentioned it was best for us to wear tight clothing because it made it easier to see what our bodies were doing.  
And, here&#8217;s the other thing &#8230; ALL of my pants are tight on my ass. I have a big butt, thighs and hips and a tiny waist. So no matter if I am wearing yoga pants, jeans or even nice slacks they are all tight (and apparently enticing).  
I pretty much live in my yoga pants. They are comfortable and functional. I am ready for a yoga home practice, lounging around the house, running errands, taking a cycle class, a yoga class, etc.  
But I believe what this really comes down to is what you feel comfortable in. We all should feel comfortable in what we wear and with our bodies. And we can&#8217;t control what other people think.
