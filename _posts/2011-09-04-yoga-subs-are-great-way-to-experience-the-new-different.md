    I had been eyeing these cute socks at Namaste Yoga studio for sometime. I finally bought them the other day ... on sale!

Today my Vinyasa Flow class had a sub. The class was taught by Emily. I like her style. I have taken class from her before.  
After class I told her I enjoyed her class and style. She told me the type of yoga it was, which I don&#8217;t remember now what it was called. I found it funny that I didn&#8217;t realize that it wasn&#8217;t actually a Vinyasa Flow class.  
The type of yoga Emily teaches apparently isn&#8217;t really being taught in the East Bay. I hope she becomes a regular instructor at Namaste.  
Regardless, the class was good, tough, sweaty, intriguing and I learned something about me and my practice. If most or all those factors come into a class it means it was a good practice for me.  
When we were meditating at the end of class Emily read us something (many teachers do this):  
The Dalai Lama was asked what surprised him most about humanity:  
_&#8220;Man._

This really makes you think, doesn&#8217;t it?
