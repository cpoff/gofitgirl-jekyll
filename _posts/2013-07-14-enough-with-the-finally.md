    I&#8217;m doing The Sprinkler at my wedding almost 10 years ago. I got married when I was ready.

Recently I have known people who have gotten engaged. At least one person (though usually more) has a response of FINALLY!  
Sometimes when someone decides to have a baby, the response is FINALLY!  
Really, is that necessary?  
If someone wants to get married or not, have a baby or not, shouldn&#8217;t that be their business?  
There are a multitude of reasons why people FINALLY get married, move in together, get engaged, have a baby, buy a house or whatever. These are all major commitments, which shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly. I believe these type of life decisions should be made with an informed and educated decision.  
I have to admit that years ago when a girlfriend told me that she and her boyfriend had gotten engaged my response was FINALLY! Guh! I can&#8217;t believe that I said that.  
I am a child of divorce &#8230; many divorces.  
Which means I take marriage seriously and I would never jump into a marriage before I was ready. Not when anyone else was ready, but when I was ready! (And, of course, The Husband had to be ready as well.)  
OK, that was my soapbox rant. Aren&#8217;t you glad Go Fit Girl! is back posting regularly?  
And Congrats to all my recently engaged, pregnant, married, new homeowner friends &#8230;
