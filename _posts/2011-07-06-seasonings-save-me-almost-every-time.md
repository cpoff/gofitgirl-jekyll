    My "tuna salad" for dinner tonight. Easy to make, delicious and filling.
  </p>
</div>

  
I indulged at lunch today. So I am trying to keep it simple and low calorie for dinner.  
For dinner tonight, I am having &#8220;tuna salad.&#8221;  
Some Spring Mix Greens went on a plate. In a separate bowl I dumped a can of light drained tuna, which was stored in water, not oil. In the bowl of tuna I added some garlic (I like to buy the crushed garlic in a jar), a small tomato from our garden, salt, pepper, Kick&#8217;n Chicken and onion powder. (The onion powder was a mistake buy about a month ago. It ended up being a great seasoning mistake.)  
I dumped the tuna on top of the mixed greens and spritzed with [Ranch Salad Spritzer](http://www.wish-bone.com/Dressings/2060/Ranch.aspx).  
The best part of this meal is all the seasonings I added. My staples are the [crushed garlic in a jar](http://www.christopherranch.com/products/index.htm), [crushed pepper](http://www.mccormick.com/Products/Herbs-and-Spices/Grinders/Black-Peppercorn-Grinder.aspx), salt, [Kick&#8217;n Chicken](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00473VHGM/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B000OP4BH4&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0CABQYAKYEX6H5TJ9TZG) and onion powder.
