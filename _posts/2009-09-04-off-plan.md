In Weight Watchers when you aren&#8217;t tracking your food and doing well it is called off plan. Well, today I am definitely off plan.  
My in-laws are in town, Ed and Marilyn, and the four of us went out to an early dinner when I got home tonight. We headed to [Triple Rock](http://www.triplerock.com/). Love their garlic fries and hard ciders. I also had a mac & cheese&#8211;which I think is new. Man, it was good &#8230; but so greasy and unhealthy.  
I was hoping to get a walk in today during the work day. But didn&#8217;t happen. I think I will make it to spin tomorrow. And Monday we are heading to Muir Woods.
