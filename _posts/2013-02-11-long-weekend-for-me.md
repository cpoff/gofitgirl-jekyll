As I have posted lately that lots of changes are going on in my life right now, especially at work. And frankly, I am having a hard time dealing with them.  
I am finding myself more emotional than normal, exhausted, deflated &#8230;  
Last Monday I decided it would be a good idea for me to take Friday off from work.  
That night Curt and I were chatting and decided to head to Monterey over the past weekend to watch our good family friend Tag play golf at Pebble Beach. Beautiful golf course, sun and sometimes an occasional adult beverage to carry around and sip.  
Friday morning I headed to the gym, showered, walked to Peet&#8217;s for coffee and oatmeal and sat down and utilized the free wi-fi for a bit to work on some blog posts, including this one. I ran some errands and did some stuff just for me. I did some shopping, got a mani/pedi and was a lady who lunches, which is my dream job.  
My spare time lately is quite limited and I don&#8217;t want to spend most of it running errands, cleaning the house, paying bills, etc., which seems to be the norm lately. I need some veg time just for me. And sometimes I need to do absolutely nothing.  
So I decided to have an extra long weekend and I took today off as well. I made the choice to take a long weekend for me.  
Today was much more of a lazy day. I caught up on some shows, watched random TV and movies, paid some bills, did some laundry, did a little house cleaning, Â got ready for my work week and did this all while staying in my jammies until I left the house about 4:30 to run an errand and then head to the gym for my regular 5:30 gym class.  
I feel ready, relaxed and able to take on my work week.
