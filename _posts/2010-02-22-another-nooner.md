I went to the noon spin class today at the gym.  
I rushed out of work a little before noon to hit class. In my rush I forgot to grab one of my many water bottles. So when I got to the gym I had to buy one. And I have to drink water while spinning.  
The class is scheduled for 50 minutes. But it usually goes over, which is fine. But at about 45 minutes into the class I started my cool down.  
I had to take a quick shower, get back into my work clothes, fix my hair and put on a little make up before I headed back to work.  
I hope to make this class a regular part of my routine &#8230; that is if yoga never comes back in the morning.
