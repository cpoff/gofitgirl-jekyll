This morning Ed, Marilyn, (my in-laws) Curt and I headed to [Muir Woods](http://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm). We got there about 9 a.m. and had a nice walk and slight trail hike. The weather was perfect, the trees magnificent and the scenery gorgeous. We opted for the 2-mile scenic walk.  
After our walk we headed to [Stinson Beach](http://www.stinsonbeachonline.com/) for lunch. We found a cute little place and sat in the warm sun.
