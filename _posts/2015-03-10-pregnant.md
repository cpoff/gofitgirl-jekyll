    In my yoga teacher training we learned about women&#8217;s issues, such as being pregnant. We did a yoga practice with a &#8220;pregnant&#8221; belly strapped on.

I had a student recently ask me what poses she should <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not</strong></span> be doing while pregnant.  
I told her what I knew off hand. But I told her I would do some research and let her know the next time I saw her.  
So this, of course, has prompted a post.  
If you are pregnant you should check in with your doctor and discuss any form of exercise, yoga included. Please make sure to discuss with your doctor since I am not a doctor and I am not your doctor.  
After you tell your doctor and partner that you are pregnant you should tell your yoga teacher that you are pregnant. Sometimes we can&#8217;t tell because you are so early and/or aren&#8217;t showing. And if you are showing, we can&#8217;t assume you are pregnant because &#8230; what if you&#8217;re not &#8230;  
From my own knowledge, what I have learned from my teachers and the research I have done online, here is some basic information.  
Yoga poses you should avoid when pregnant:

  * deep twists
  * lying (flat) on your back (once into your second trimester)
  * lying on your belly (first trimester is likely OK, after that it should be avoided)
  * poses that work your abs
  * deep forward folds
  * extreme backbends

Yoga poses (and other things) to be mindful of when pregnant:

  * you need to take it easy&#8211;you&#8217;ve got a baby growing inside of you
  * inversions (there is a debate on whether or not this is OK to do when pregnant, especially if you practiced inversions before you were pregnant)&#8211;see the first item in this list (take it easy)
  * hot yoga is a bad idea when pregnant (or in my opinion, anytime)
  * if your gym/yoga studio offers gentle yoga classes or classes designed for pregnant women you should take those

When women are pregnant they become much more &#8220;flexible&#8221; because of the pregnancy hormone relaxin, which allows the uterus to expand, and also softens connective tissue. Which means a pregnant woman can go too deep into a pose.  
I mentioned earlier that I did some research online. I read through articles on [PopSugar](http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/What-Avoid-Yoga-When-Pregnant-22617147), [Baby Center](http://www.babycenter.com/404_is-it-safe-to-do-yoga-during-pregnancy_5699.bc), [About.com](http://yoga.about.com/od/prenatalyoga/a/Prenatal-Yoga-Dos-And-Donts.htm) and [Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/332706-yoga-poses-avoid-during-pregnancy/).  
There&#8217;s a lot of information out there. What I read through seems pretty good. But be careful what you read. My blog included. It&#8217;s always best to talk to your doctor.  
Being pregnant and caring for another human being is important and shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly. Take care of yourself and your baby and honor your body.
