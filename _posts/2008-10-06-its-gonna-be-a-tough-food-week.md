This past weekend was already a challenge in the food department with many activities planned.  
This week is going to pose many more challenges. (Jen had asked me a food question, which I will answer eventually that kinda goes along this subject.)  
Tonight my work is hosting a function for the home employees and remote employees. Work is generous with the yummy food and drinks.  
Thursday is my birthday and I am having lunch with my friend Mia. Then Curt and I are eating out that night with friends&#8217; Monica and Malcolm at [Sushiya](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=sushiya+oakland&fb=1&view=text&latlng=2649843237625389898). Dinner out will be sushi, so that is pretty healthy.  
Friday lunch the Legal (work) team is taking me out to celebrate&#8211;sushi again, so fairly healthy and easy to make good choices at [Miyozen](http://www.gotsushiandsake.com/). (Can you tell I love sushi?!?) Friday night dinner out with friends Sue and Alicia at [Townhouse](http://www.townhousebarandgrill.com/). I loved the grilled veggies, polenta and pesto.  
Saturday night Dad and Hilda are coming over to our neighborhood for dinner. We are going to celebrate mine and Hilda&#8217;s birthdays. Hers was last month. Not sure yet where we are going to eat. [Marica&#8217;s](http://www.themenupage.com/marica.html) is a contender. Ohhh, or maybe [Tratorria La Siciliana](http://www.trattorialasiciliana.com/). So many delicious choices!  
Then Sunday Mia, Lexi (Mia&#8217;s daughter) and I are gonna celebrate my birthday with lunch and mani/pedis girl day.  
Whew! So to counter all that yummy food and soy sauce I am going to have to workout like a crazy woman. I have started off the week right with a yoga practice this morning, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
