Curt are in Albany, MO this weekend. We are here visiting his parents and also for deer season.  
Curt&#8217;s brother and our nephews were also here&#8211;they left today.  
My mother-in-law, Marilyn, is an amazing cook. We have had butterscotch rolls, pumpkin pie, tenderloin sandwiches, pot roast, ham, apple salad and so much more.  
Of course, the exercise has been minimal. But I have taken Katie for a walk a couple of times. So that&#8217;s better than nothing, right.
