    My gym bag was packed and ready to go last week and will be this week as well.Â

This past week was Week 2 back to healthy living.  
It was a challenging week at work. I didn&#8217;t just work long hours, they were also intense hours.  
I kept my gym bag packed and ready to go in the trunk every day.  
Monday and Tuesday I worked long hours but was still able to muster enough energy to exercise on my own at the gym.  
By the time Wednesday hit I didn&#8217;t get home until 8 and Thursday I was just spent.  
I decided to listen to my body and take a break.  
I still tried to maintain my healthy eating habits with a few cheats here and there.  
But as we all know life happens and some things are beyond our control.  
I did take yoga with Vickie this morning, which was what I needed physically and mentally.  
But my dear friends and readers, Go Fit Girl! is still here. Just know that the posts may be minimal but I will back to normal soon. I have all sorts of ideas. I hope to share them with you soon.  
Stay tuned.
