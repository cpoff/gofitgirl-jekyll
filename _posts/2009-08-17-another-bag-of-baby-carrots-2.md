I had my weekly weigh-in today. And the number on the scale was good news. I lost 2 more pounds.  
I am just trying to take one week and and one day at a time. I think I am doing pretty well. And if all continues on track I will be at my goal weight (and maybe a little under) before Curt and I head to Europe.
