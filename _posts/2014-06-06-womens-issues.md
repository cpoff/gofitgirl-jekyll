I am coming around the corner and I can see the end &#8230; I graduate from Piedmont&#8217;s Deep Yoga teacher training program at the end of this month!  
Last night in yoga teacher training we went over two topics: Women&#8217;s Issues and Being a Yoga Teacher.  
I&#8217;ve been looking forward to the women&#8217;s issues topic as it is very important to us as teachers.  
According to  a study done by [Yoga Journal](http://www.yogajournal.com/press/yoga_in_america) in 2012, 82.2 percent of yoga practitioners are women.  
The women&#8217;s issues we discussed were the three transitions women can face in life: menstruation, pregnancy and menopause.  
We did a yoga practice as if we were pregnant. Ann, who was teaching us last night, had us strap on &#8220;pregnant bellies,&#8221; which was a wool blanket and a yoga strap to keep it on.  
It was a fascinating experiment, especially since I have never been pregnant. It was a great way to show us some of the physical limitations that can occur with a pregnant belly.  
We talked about challenges each transition can face and the various yoga tips to help women take on the transitions safely for themselves.  
My posting has been pretty sparse lately. But school is winding down and should be smooth sailing for the rest of this month. I hope to write more often. Thanks for hanging with me.
