    If you have to use momentum to lift your weights they are likely too heavy.Â

This is gonna be a smorgasbord of a post &#8230;  
First, I am now an LA Fitness employee, a yoga and cycle group fitness instructor. Starting soon I will be teaching three cycle classes and one yoga class with the hopes of adding some more yoga classes.  
I&#8217;ve been taking yoga classes at the town house community fitness center. And I have had the opportunity to sub three of those classes already. I subbed a yoga class at another gym near me.  
I took a body conditioning/body sculpting class on Wednesday. I have the possibility to teach this class as well after some training.  
I haven&#8217;t taken a class like that in more than a year. Wow, two days later and I am still sore.  
As we were working our weights the teacher reminded us that momentum is not a muscle. That really stuck with me.  
Sometime back I wrote a post about how it is important to [use form and not momentum when weight training](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/11/use-form-not-momentum-when-weight-training/).  
I just might have to steal that phrase and remind my students one day that momentum is not a muscle.
