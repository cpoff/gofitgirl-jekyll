    Meditation and setting an intention are such positive and relatively easy things to do in our yoga practice and everyday life.

There are a lot of things I love about practicing yoga.  
One of my favorite things is at the beginning of practice you set an intention.  
I like how [this article describes setting an intention](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-4945/The-Power-of-Setting-an-Intention-in-Yoga.html), (setting an intention connects) the what I’m doing with the why I’m doing it in a body-mind-spirit manner. I find that when I set a thought, affirmation or prayer to my movements, I am much more present in my breath, more inspired to complete my practice. Setting an intention is a personal ritual.  
Most of my yoga teachers ask us to set an intention at the beginning of class. When I practice alone in my home practice I set an intention.  
My set intentions vary. Sometimes I set it for myself, my practice or for someone I care about who could use the extra positive energy.  
Yesterday in class for the first time I set an intention toward someone who has been hurtful to me recently. I don&#8217;t want to have the negative energy take over.  
I am someone who holds grudges, I get my feelings hurt easily and I tend to let negative feelings fester inside.  
I am trying to learn how to let some of that go. Holding on to negative feelings and energy just isn&#8217;t worth it. Wasting my energy isn&#8217;t helpful to me or my well-being.  
So I am working on dealing with the hurt and moving on the best I can.  
And thanks to yoga and my practice to helping me learn to deal with that.
