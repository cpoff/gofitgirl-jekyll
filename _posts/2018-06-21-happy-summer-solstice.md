Welcome Summer!  
Read below for some fun ways to welcome Summer with me today, tomorrow and Saturday.  
According to [The Old Farmer&#8217;s Almanac](https://www.almanac.com/content/first-day-summer-summer-solstice) Summer Solstice happens today, Thursday, June 21, 2018 specifically at 6:07 a.m. EDT (3:07 a.m. EDT).  
In the Northern Hemisphere, the June solstice occurs when the Sun reaches both its highest and northernmost points in the sky. (In contrast, the June solstice in the Southern Hemisphere is when the Sun is at its lowest point in the sky.)  
The word “solstice” comes from Latin _solstitium_—from _sol_ (sun) and _stitium_ (to stop), reflecting the fact that on the solstice, the sun appears to stop moving in the sky as it reaches its northern- or southernmost point. After the solstice, the sun appears to reverse course and head back in the opposite direction.  
The timing of the June solstice is not based on a specific calendar date or time; it all depends on when the sun reaches its northernmost point from the equator. Therefore, the June solstice won’t always occur on the same day.  
Richard Rosen, explains why we practice Sun Salutes: “You are saluting the outside sun for providing life to the planet, and your internal sun for providing consciousness.”  
Join me in celebrating summer today by practicing Sun Saltues/Sun Salutations/Surya Namaskar.

**Coffee with a Yogi**  
<a href="http://gofitgirl.com/2018/06/happy-summer-solstice/coffee-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-16129"><img class="alignleft wp-image-16129 size-thumbnail" src="http://gofitgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/coffee-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>I&#8217;m guest teaching at Coffee with a Yogi  this coming Saturday, June 23 at Solace Fine & Espresso in Beaverton.  
Yoga is at 10 a.m. for all levels. Coffee/tea and conversation after.
