I started a project this afternoon and was on a roll. At about 5:10 I started the debate, stay and work or go to spin and sweat. Yea, not the best options to have to hash out.  
I decided that the work would be there tomorrow. And I am really trying to achieve and maintain work/life balance. And taking care of myself is the life part.  
At about 6:30 the fire alarm went off. It was ear-piercing and that damn flashing light. Argh! It wouldn&#8217;t stop. And John, the instructor, decided to stop class. We were right near one of the alarms and it was so freakin&#8217; loud.  
After class was over early I decided to grab my iPhone and listen to some music (loudly) while doing some weights, [which Sarah, yoga instructor, recommended](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3108). I worked on lateral pulls and triceps.  
So in the end it worked out. Because I got kinda annoyed that I had chosen to leave work early and go to class. HA! I say early&#8211;really I mean on time. So sad.
