Last year around this time one of my awesome yoga teacher&#8217;s, Vickie, mentioned Madly in Love with Me, which is a project, a mission, a passion created by one of her friends.  
I looked at the site a little. But never gave it the time I should.  
I recently asked her about it and she reminded me of the name: [Madly in Love with Me](http://madlyinlovewithme.com). (There&#8217;s a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MadlyInLoveWithMe) for it, too.)  
I have done a little research on the site and I just love the idea of self-love. (AND it goes with [Go Fit Girl!&#8217;s February Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10173) theme about taking care of No. 1. If you want to join the challenge, you can [click right here](https://www.facebook.com/events/524269487617141/) to go to the Facebook event page.)  
The stated mission of Madly in Love with Me is: Our mission is to reclaim self-love for every woman and girl on this planet, so that she may know what it is to be deeply loved, starting with the love she has for herself.  
Some excerpts from the blog on what self-love is, why it is needed and what it means: __  
_Why Self-Love? While it is true that women and girls have more equality and self-esteem that ever before, something isn’t changing. We believe that something is self-love … while self-esteem is something we want every woman and girl to have, knowing that you can do anything doesn’t stop women and girls from beating themselves up, putting themselves into abusive relationships or hating and destroying their bodies._  
_Madly in Love with ME™ is an international self-love movement. It was created to raise the awareness of self-love among women and girls around the world … and to provide a pathway that gives those women and girls the guidance, support, wisdom and inspiration they need to freely and fully live and love the women they are, free of self-criticism, self-hatred and self-abuse._  
As a woman who has struggled and worked hard for everything I have and has experienced the opposite of self-love numerous times in my life I support other women and want them to experience themselves they way they should. (By the way, dudes can experience self-love, too.)  
I think as women and human beings we are a powerful force and can support each other along the way.  
And here&#8217;s to loving me.
