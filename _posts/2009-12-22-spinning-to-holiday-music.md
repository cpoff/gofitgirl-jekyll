Let&#8217;s just say it was interesting. Though most of the Christmas music was hip hop so there was a good beat going. The Feliz Navidad sung by an Italian opera singer was &#8230; um, bizarre. Boku kept telling us to find the beat. I just couldn&#8217;t.  
He didn&#8217;t play all Christmas music. When It&#8217;s Raining Men came on I wanted to jump off my bike and start dancing.  
Man, I don&#8217;t want to even admit all the crap I have been eating lately. I had a huge cream puff today. I can&#8217;t believe I ate that whole thing. Man, it was good.  
I am going to have to detox at some point soon.
