**Guest post: Michael, our first Go Fit Boy!**  
Did you know that when Coca-Cola was introduced in 1886, it was available only in 8-ounce servings? Both in fountain glasses and bottles, 8 ounces was it. Later, it went to 12 ounces, a 50% increase.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Then up from there. Now, at <span id="lw_1254835000_0" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">convenience stores</span>, you can get a &#8220;<span id="lw_1254835000_1" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">big gulp</span>&#8221; or some other similarly named sugar-laden soft drink often approaching or even exceeding 32 ounces. That&#8217;s a 300% increase from the originally intended serving size. It&#8217;s also 300% more empty-calorie sugar than the original serving.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Coca-Cola and other soft drinks are the extreme example of the &#8220;super-sizing&#8221; of our diets. Big increases have occurred with <span id="lw_1254835000_2" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">food portion sizes</span> in many restaurants and on our home dining tables.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Our allowance of &#8212; nay, insistence on &#8212; <span id="lw_1254835000_3" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">portion size increase</span> and thus amount of food we take in is largely responsible for all the weight we Americans have gained.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Control <span id="lw_1254835000_4" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">portion size</span>, and you control weight. Period.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> <span id="lw_1254835000_5" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; cursor: pointer; background-image: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: transparent; border-bottom-style: none; border-bottom-width: initial; border-bottom-color: initial; background-position: initial initial;">Dietitians</span> and physicians throughout the land generally recommend portions that run in the range of 3-5 ounces for most foods we eat regularly, both meal foods and snack foods.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Yet, we find ourselves constantly tempted with advertising images for that 12-ounce steak, or that half-pound burger or that $5 foot-long.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Here&#8217;s a fairly simple way to measure portion size and stick to it. Use your cell phone as the measuring device.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> A 3-ounce piece of steak is roughly the size of a cell phone.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> A 3-ounce piece of chicken is roughly the size of a cell phone.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> One cup of <span id="lw_1254835000_6" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">French fries</span> &#8212; about 10 fries, by the way &#8212; is about the size of a cell phone.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Same goes for a <span id="lw_1254835000_7" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">piece of cake</span>, a piece of fish, a burger patty.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> You get the idea.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> If the portion size that you are considering eating is much bigger than your cell phone, it&#8217;s likely more of that than you need to eat in one sitting.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Portion size is much easier to control when cooking at home than when going out. But even in restaurants, it is possible.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> My wife and I have managed, part of the time at least, to share a meal rather than each of us ordering our own in restaurants. It saves money, and often, to our surprise, we don&#8217;t finish it all even when sharing.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Moral of the story: Control portion size and you control weight.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /> Put another way: If you happen to be one of that very odd few people out there without a food portion measuring device called a cell phone, it&#8217;s time to get one and use it.
