On Tuesday and yesterday I took public transport to work: BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit). The Bay Area&#8217;s version of a subway.  
Normally I drive to a parking area close to my house and jump on a shuttle, which takes us the rest of the roughly 20 miles to work.  
But the shuttle schedule recently changed, which means if I take the shuttle I don&#8217;t make my evening 5:45 and 6 p.m. yoga classes.  
(I was supposed to go to yoga last night. But a last minute decision with friends at work had us having a fun night out drinking and eating, which we really needed.)  
I decided to experiment this week with public transport. Besides the long ride and the crowded train where a seat isn&#8217;t available until people start offloading into the city (aka San Francisco) there are wardrobe issues.  
I usually wear heels to work (yes, I know they are terrible for your feet).  
In fact, I did a whole feet week on GFG! a few years ago. ([The worst shoes for your feet](http://gofitgirl.com/2011/10/the-worst-shoes-for-your-feet/); [It&#8217;s feet week](http://gofitgirl.com/2011/10/its-feet-week/); [And feet week concludes](http://gofitgirl.com/2011/10/and-feet-week-concludes/); and [Comment Contest Tuesday](http://gofitgirl.com/2011/10/comment-contest-tuesday-8/).)  
And most of my pants are rather long since I wear heels, which means flats are not an option with those pants.  
Anyway, I wore flats on Tuesday and shorter length pants. I do have a a few pairs.  
As I was on the train observing other women I noticed that there is a wardrobe culture for women riding public transport. Most women were wearing pants, which went to their ankles in length, and were wearing flats.  
I tried to find information on this topic and didn&#8217;t. I, of course, didn&#8217;t do a ton of digging but I spent a considerable amount of time looking. But I did find specific instructions on how to take a bus.  
I found a blog post asking us: [Will you join the flat shoe society?](http://fabrickated.com/2014/07/17/will-you-join-the-flat-shoe-society/) But this was more about &#8220;high heel hell.&#8221; There&#8217;s one quick mention of public transport: &#8230; public transport would cease if women habitually wore high heels.  
I normally plan my outfits for the weather. And some days it will also be for easy access to and for public transport.
