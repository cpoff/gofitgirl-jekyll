I went to my regular 1 p.m. Tuesday yoga class. We had a sub. She was pretty good. But not as good as Sean.  
The class was packed. That class is usually pretty full with 10-14 attending. Today we had at least 20 in the class. A lot of new faces. Wonder how long that will last.  
I hate the beginning of the year at the gym. Classes are super full, the machines are all taken up. Last year the gym stayed extra busy until about March. Too long! Oh well, guess I have to be patient.
