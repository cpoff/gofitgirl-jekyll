I had a training in the city today. I wasn&#8217;t sure what time I would be back in the East Bay. Though I knew I would be back in plenty of time for the 7:30 p.m. yoga class. I am not a huge fan of that class and I knew I might convince myself not to go.  
I got home at 5:50. And the class I wanted to try to go to started at 6. Luckily I had my yoga clothes laying out. I quickly changed, powdered my nose and filled up my water bottle and out the door I went.  
I got to the class about a minute before it started.  
It is a new class in that time slot called Deep Flow.  
We started off in [savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482). OK, if we are starting off in corpse pose then it has to be a great class, right?  
It was a pretty good class. We focused on shoulders. I would have liked a little more active flow.  
For part of the class we kept a block between our thighs. It was a great way to focus your body on the strength of your legs. We did this in Downward Facing Dog, Plank, [reverse table top](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2474), etc.  
As we were in class and David was talking I kept thinking his voice sounded familiar. Then I realized he is the Wheel of Yoga guy.  
At the end of class I asked him if he was now regularly teaching in that time slot. And then I mentioned that I knew him from Wheel of Yoga.
