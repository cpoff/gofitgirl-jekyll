Yesterday I broke my exercise streak. The horrendous commute home got me to my house a little after 6. My Wednesday night Hatha class with Baxter starts at 6.  
I could have gone to the 7:30 class. But I wasn&#8217;t in the mood. Plus, I had to make and eat dinner and do all the things that needed to be done for the evening&#8211;shower, get gym bag together, get clothes ready for work. (I didn&#8217;t blog last night&#8211;so I didn&#8217;t need to do that.)  
Yesterday a co-worker and I went to a taqueria for lunch. I had my leftovers for dinner plus two regular beers. So yesterday was anything but healthy.  
Today at work, the cafe was serving [chile relleno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_relleno). Oh man. I had to have it for lunch. It was good. (Not as good as the one my aunt makes, which my nana used to make as well.)  
I really had to motivate myself to hit the gym today. I wasn&#8217;t feeling it. I really needed some motivation. But I knew I had to work off some of that food and lack of exercise yesterday.

So I did an hour on the spin bike at the work gym. I went with the most hard core workout on the bike: Race Day for 60 minutes. And I worked hard and sweated and felt a tiny bit better about my recent caloric intake.
