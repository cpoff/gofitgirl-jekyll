    Working those guns while listening to some tunes.

I went down to the work gym today about 4:15 (later than I wanted, lately something seems to come up at work to push into my exercise time) and the spin bike was being used. First time in about seven months that I have gone down and wanted to use the bike and it wasn&#8217;t free.  
I decided to reverse my workout and start with arms, then abs and then cardio&#8211;if the spin bike became available with enough time to have at least 30 minutes of cardio. And if it wasn&#8217;t I would just do an elliptical or treadmill.  
As I was finishing working out my arms with some hard core weights (that was a joke) the woman on the espinner was finished with her cardio. Perfect timing.  
I jumped on the spin bike and did about 30 minutes of endurance. Once I was done with my cardio I did about 10 minutes of abs.  
Then I had about 10 minutes to grab a snack, fill up my water bottle, hit the restroom and jump on the shuttle bus.
