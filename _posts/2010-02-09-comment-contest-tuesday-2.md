<span>I got this idea from a friend&#8217;s post one day on Facebook.</span>  
<span>So to repeat Kristen, </span>**what do you eat when you&#8217;re feeling very snacky but don&#8217;t need (or want) to consume a bunch of calories/fat?**  
<span>To reiterate the rules for Comment Contest Tuesday &#8230;</span>  
In the comments, answer the above **question**. You can comment as much as you like. The comment has to be relevant to the actual question. Up to three comments will be counted. In other words, you can comment five times, but your name will be put in the hat three times for the drawing of the winner. Make sense? Winner and prize will be announced on Monday.  
You have until Friday at noon (my time) to comment away. You have to comment in the comments on Go Fit Girl! I won’t accept e-mails, comments on Facebook, etc.  
OK, comment away. I can’t wait to hear your all your snack ideas.
