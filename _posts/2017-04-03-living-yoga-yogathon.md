I am participating in fundraising for Living Yoga&#8217;s Yogathon in the month of April.  
[Living Yoga](http://living-yoga.org) is a nonprofit in Portland, which is changing lives by fostering healing and resilience in vulnerable and marginalized communities through trauma-informed yoga.  
Living Yoga brings trauma-informed yoga classes to prisons, youth centers, addiction facilities and to people in the community who would not otherwise have access to yoga.  
You can find [my fundraising page here](https://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/ann-chihakpoff/2017-living-yoga-yogathon).  
I am teaching a benefit class at [Turtles Yoga & Wellness](http://turtlesyoga.com) this month. All proceeds will be donated to Living Yoga.  
**What:** All levels Hatha benefit class  
**When:** Saturday, April 22  
**Time:** noon-1 p.m.  
**Where:** Turtles Yoga & Wellness in Beaverton  
**Suggested donation:** $5-10 (all proceeds will go to Living Yoga)  
My donation-based Hatha benefit class will have an emphasis on anatomy and alignment with a focus on celebrating Earth Day. The class will incorporate yoga poses, regulated breathing and meditation with a little fun and humor thrown in. All levels are supported and welcome.  
You can come to class and donate and/or you can go to my fundraising page, link above. You can also donate to [Turtles&#8217; fundraising page by clicking here](https://www.firstgiving.com/team/348710).
