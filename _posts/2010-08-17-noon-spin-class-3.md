Yesterday and today I attended the noon spin class. I normally go on Mondays. Tuesdays I try to go to the evening class&#8211;but that is getting tougher lately. Plus my fave spin teacher, Jennifer, was subbing.  
Work has been insane and it can be tough to leave at a reasonable hours. It is a challenge to leave in the middle of the day, too. But I just make sure to do it. I mark out the time on my work calendar and I just make sure I go. There are times that meetings take priority. But today and yesterday I was able to exercise.  
I feel so much better afterward. I am able to tackle more, have more energy, am a little less tired (long hours make you tired whether or not you exercise) and just feel much more productive.
