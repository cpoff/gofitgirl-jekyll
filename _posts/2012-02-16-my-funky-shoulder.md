    Sleeping with arms above the head can cause some shoulder issues.

I think I have mentioned my weird shoulder in past posts. I don&#8217;t really know what I did to it. And it is hard to explain what is wrong with it. It sometimes feels like something is slipping out of place. It doesn&#8217;t hurt. It is more of a discomfort.  
It is noticeable that something funky is going on during some yoga poses, such as [Downward Dog](http://www.cnyhealingarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/shanna-downward-facing-dog.jpg) or even with my [arms up in the air right before a Vinyasa flow](http://www.yogaweb.com/yoga/images/asanas/Tadasana.jpg) or while holding [Warrior I](http://yogijessi.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/warrior-1-yoga.jpg) or [Crecent Lunge](http://www.theholisticwoman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Crescent-Lunge-Photo.jpg).  
When I was at the doctor on Monday I mentioned my shoulder to her. I tried to explain to her the funky sensation I have at times in my shoulder.  
She asked me if I sleep with my arms above my head. I told her I do. (I pretty much sleep in all positions: on my stomach [not good], on my sides, on my back and sometimes with my arms above my head.)  
The doctor told me I should try to stop sleeping with my arms above my head. She said it is likely a slipped tendon.Â Then she asked me how I thought I could stop sleeping with my arms above my head. Uhhhh?  
She suggested somehow tying something to my pajamas and giving myself some room to move my arms, but not enough to reach them above my head.  
I haven&#8217;t actually tied anything to my jammies or arms. The first night anytime I noticed that I was moving my arms above my head I would move them back to my sides. Second night wasn&#8217;t quite as successful&#8211;but that was also a terrible night of sleep. Last night I definitely noticed and corrected my arms at times.  
My doctor also mentioned that the shoulder issue could become a rotator cuff issue. And I definitely don&#8217;t want to deal with that.
