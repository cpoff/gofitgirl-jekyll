It has only been three days since I have been a commuter. And I realize I need to give it a little time. But my routine is all out of whack.  
I either arrive too late or too early for a class. Monday I arrived in Emeryville about 6:30 p.m., which was about 15 minutes too late to the 6:30 spin class. Tuesday I arrived in Emeryville at 5 p.m., which once at the gym I was there about 45 minutes too early for Tuesday night spin. I did weights and then spin class. Tonight the 4:15 p.m. shuttle took more than an hour, which made me late for my 6 p.m. yoga class in my hood. By the time I got home it was 6:45 I could have hurried and gotten to the studio right at 6. But I decided not to hurry and be rushed&#8211;plus Curt and I had a friend in town and Â I wanted to hang out and see Jacob and had a few beers, some conversation and food.  
Eventually the swanky gym at work will be open and I can experiment and use that gym in conjunction with my regular gym and yoga studio and see what works. Unfortunately commutes are never predictable and will never be the same every day and will vary at the different times.
