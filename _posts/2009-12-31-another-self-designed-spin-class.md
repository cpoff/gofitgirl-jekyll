I went back to the gym today. No classes today or tomorrow.  
So I got on the spin bike and designed my own [class again](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3294). I think I had a pretty good workout. I was tired and pretty sweaty once I was complete. I rode about 40 minutes on the bike. Then did about 10-15 minutes of abs and a little weights (biceps and triceps).  
After the gym I met my friends for lunch. Mmmmm, pizza. I am planning in detoxing myself soon from all this crap I have been eating. I love food and especially food that is unhealthy. But I don&#8217;t love feeling like crap, tired and sluggish. A bag of chips vs. and apple.
