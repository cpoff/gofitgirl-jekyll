I believe I have had shin splints in the past. In college I had 10 minutes to get all the way across campus one day and walked so fast I was almost running. Soon after that I had pain in my shins.  
According to [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/shin-splints/ds00271/dsection=causes), shin splints are caused by excessive force (overload) on the shinbone and the connective tissues that attach your muscles to the bone.  
According to [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-causes-shin-splints), shin splints can be caused when the constant pounding and stresses placed on the bones, muscles and joints overwhelm the body&#8217;s natural ability to repair the damage and restore itself.  
Since I am not a runner I rarely get shin splints.  
Running, running hard, inclines, bad shoes or old shoes can be causes of shin splints.  
Yesterday I noticed pain in my shins. I haven&#8217;t been running or walking a lot. According to [this Livestrong article](http://www.livestrong.com/article/526189-stretches-for-the-recovery-of-shin-splints/#ixzz20kHkzsMx), increasing training levels too quickly can cause shin splints.  
I pushed myself pretty hard in that total athletic conditioning class on Thursday night. The next day I had sore thighs and still do. Though I am thinking tomorrow the soreness will be finally gone, I hope. The pain in the shins is gone today. And I even wore heels to work.  
I have been walking funny with these sore thighs. Over the weekend the sore thigh muscles were causing me to jut my legs and feet out when walking, which created pressure on my shins.  
I am curious if my sore thighs have either made me put odd pressure on my shins or if shin splints can be a side effect of sore thighs?  I can&#8217;t seem to find anything to back up the theory of sore thigh muscles causing shin splints. Maybe it is out there and maybe it is not. But I only have so much time to research. And really, reading about shin splints in multiple articles is just not that exciting.  
The best solution for shin splints is rest. But seriously, for those of us who are active, are we really gonna rest?  
So here are some stretches recommended in [this Livestrong article](http://www.livestrong.com/article/526189-stretches-for-the-recovery-of-shin-splints/#ixzz20kITc9Ro): A simple stretch involves sitting on a chair shoeless while extending one leg straight. Flex the toes and foot toward your body, then point the toes away. This stretches the lower leg muscles. Another effective stretch uses a step. Stand on a step, facing it. Slide back slightly to allow your heels to freely drop below the step. With a slight knee bend, lower the heel. Then lift as high as possible on your toes.  
Be kind to your body and your shins.
