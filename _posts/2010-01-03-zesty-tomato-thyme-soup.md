Lisa shared this [Zesty-Tomato Thyme Soup recipe](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3300) with me.  
I made it for dinner tonight. It was easy and quick to make. And it was yummy. I may play with the ingredients next time. But I thought it was really good as is. Next time I make it I will likely double the recipe to make a little more. I have some for lunch tomorrow. And another lunch or two later in the week.  
Try the recipe. And if you do let me know what you think and if you made any adjustments.
