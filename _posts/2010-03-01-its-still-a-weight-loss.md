After another week of counting calories I was excited to weigh in and see another loss on the scale.  
There was a loss, just not as much as I was hoping. 0.4 was my weight loss. I was hoping it would be at least a pound. But it wasn&#8217;t a gain and it was actually a loss.  
Let&#8217;s see how next week&#8217;s weigh in goes.
