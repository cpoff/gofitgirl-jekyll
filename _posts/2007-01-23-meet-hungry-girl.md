Meet [Hungry Girl](http://food.yahoo.com/blog/hungrygirl).  
She maintains a blog all about food. She writes about some cool stuff. I just found her today through my Yahoo!  
Today I was reading about [Little Light Lies](http://food.yahoo.com/blog/hungrygirl/1040/little-light-lies;_ylt=AnVx7CumjKUbFy5YCDY3u29mY.Y5), food that says it is light, but it ain&#8217;t. She also wrote about [healthier options](http://food.yahoo.com/blog/hungrygirl/3/top-ten-guilt-free-fast-food-finds;_ylt=At5xb6fZwCBB0RF.R5VFcq9mY.Y5) at Fast Food restaurants.  
  
She also linked up to a 1 point [fettucine recipe](http://www.hungry-girl.com/week/weeklydetails.php?isid=468). She gives the nutritional information, which is great for someone like me who is counting points.
