    We had a lovely view of the Golden Gate Bridge during our 3-mile walk.

Today I participated in a charity walk with work and for the [MMRF](http://www.themmrf.org/). (There&#8217;s still time to donate if you are so inclined. [Click here](http://support.themmrf.org/site/TR/RaceforResearch/General?px=1569738&pg=personal&fr_id=1390) for my page. Thanks to those who have already donated.)  
Since I didn&#8217;t have time to go to yoga (and parking and driving into that part of the city can be a nightmare) I decided to take BART (subway) and then walk to the [Marina Green](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Green), where the walk took place.  
Just getting there was a 3-mile walk. I gave myself plenty of time. It took me about an hour to walk. I got to walk through a lot of the city and see some areas I hadn&#8217;t seen before. I made sure I had water and snacks with me.  
I had never been to the Marina Green area before. And I realized that THIS is what people do on a beautiful Sunday in the city: There were runners, bikers, walkers, kite fliers, dogs, beachgoers, etc.  
The MMRF walk/run was a 5K (~3 miles). There was a good turn out for both Team Onyx and the entire event. I walked with a few other ladies who were just fine to walk at a pace I was comfortable with.  
After the walk/run a group of us rewarded ourselves with beer and burgers (and a few other eats). It was a fun group to hang out with (some were regular friends and others were people I don&#8217;t normally hang out with).  
I got home not too long ago. I took a well-deserved shower and am resting my tired feet. I should sleep well tonight.
