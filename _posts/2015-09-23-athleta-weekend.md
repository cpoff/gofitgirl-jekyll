    The top photo is of the Fit6 lifestyle pants wearing models I hung out with at Athleta Brewery Blocks on Saturday from 1-3 p.m. The middle photo is me getting &#8220;fitted&#8221; with The Ponte pants and a <a href="http://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?vid=1&pid=721632002">Suri Bubble top</a>. The bottom left and bottom right are of me at Athleta Washington Square getting ready to answer those burning questions about yoga.

On Friday and Saturday I had events at the two Athleta stores in Portland.  
On Friday I was at Athleta Washington Square for Ask a Yogi with Ann. I was available to answer any questions shoppers had about yoga.  
It went OK. It was challenging getting people engaged. I think they thought I was trying to sell them something.  
But I had fun and chatted up many women. I even helped some shop and let them know about the great deals going on in the store over the weekend.  
On Saturday I was at Athleta Brewery Blocks (in The Pearl) to model a pair of Fit6 pants along with other FitPros (fitness professionals).  
I ended up modeling a pair of [The Ponte](http://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=724799002&vid=1&locale=en_US&kwid=1&sem=false&sdkw=ponte-moto-pant-P724799&sdReferer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.athleta.com%2Fproducts%2Fponte-fit-6-bottoms-C1039156.jsp) lifestyle pants. I would have never picked these pants out for myself. But I ended up loving them and keeping them.

It was fun greeting shoppers and letting them know about the sales going on. And we got to show them how the pants looked on real women.  
I got to spend a few hours with some amazing women. I made some new friends while networking and having a little fun.  
Athleta is not the only brand that I wear while teaching yoga and cycle. (I also wear Lucy, Lululemon, Nike, Beyond Yoga, Prana, REI brands &#8230;)  
Like many other brands Athleta is high quality clothing while making me look good and lasting through many washings and through my many yoga classes, cycle classes, running errands, lounging, napping, an occasional home practice (but normally I do my home practice in my jammies) &#8230;  
It&#8217;s great to be able to partner with an amazing clothing company while working with the awesome managers. I look forward to future partnerings.
