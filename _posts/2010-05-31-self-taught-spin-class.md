Today there were no classes at the gym, which was a bummer. I would have been able to make the noon spin class and gladly taken it.  
I still went to the gym today. I got on a spin bike, put in my ear buds and set the iPod on shuffle. If a song came on that I wasn&#8217;t in the mood for I would just skip to the next one. I did some sprints, climbs, seated climbs, fast climbs, etc. I worked out about 50 minutes. Not too bad on my own.
