    Be good and drink your water!

I drink a lot of water. So when I slack on the H2O my body notices it pretty quickly.  
It is important for me to keep up my water intake. It&#8217;s best if I drink 64 ounces, which is eight servings. Sometimes I only get six servings in, 48 ounces.  
On Friday night Curt and I met an out of town friend (and many of his friends) at the [Latin American Club](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&sugexp=kjrmc&cp=20&gs_id=2g&xhr=t&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&biw=1268&bih=626&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=latin+american+club+sf&fb=1&gl=us&hq=latin+american+club&hnear=0x80859a6d00690021:0x4a501367f076adff,San+Francisco,+CA&cid=13480233292018639724), which serves some famously strong margaritas.  
When I ordered the first round I also ordered a glass of water. The No. 1 rule when drinking is moderation, of course, but also for every alcoholic beverage have a glass of water. Those margaritas are big and strong.  
Eventually I ditched the water. I kinda just forgot about it. I had two margaritas. At some point we headed out to get something to eat. For some reason I decided to have a beer with my late dinner.  
I seriously planned to go to spin the next day. I woke up Saturday at about 7:30. I was so dehydrated and had a headache. And I just felt really tired.  
I don&#8217;t like to exercise when I am severely dehydrated. I just don&#8217;t think it is healthy or safe.  
So I ditched the gym and instead slept in. I needed the sleep.
