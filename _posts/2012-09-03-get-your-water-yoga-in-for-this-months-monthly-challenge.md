    Staying hydrated is an important part of staying healthy and part of GFG!&#8217;s first Monthly Challenge.

OK, GFG! readers, today marks GFG!&#8217;s first Monthly Challenge.  
There will be two challenges. One focused on exercise and one focused on nutrition.  
In honor of National Yoga Month I thought I would make the first exercise challenge about yoga.  
If you have never taken yoga before, try a class. If you occasionally or regularly practice yoga try a new teacher, class or type of yoga.  
Because it is [National Yoga Month](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/top-10-ways-celebrate-national-yoga-month-013400815--spt.html) gyms are likely offering more classes (I know mine is). Yoga studios may be offering something in honor. There could even be free yoga in the park. Check with Parks & Rec schedules in your city/town.  
The nutrition challenge for September will be about getting your daily water intake in.  
If you don&#8217;t drink much water every day (like you love the soda or Diet Coke, etc.) try to double your water in take every day for the month. If you drink a reasonable amount of water already try to get in six to eight 8 ounce servings in every single day.  
The event invite has been posted to Facebook. [Click here to view](https://www.facebook.com/events/406626752731671/). Don&#8217;t forget that you can still participate in the Monthly Challenge even if you aren&#8217;t on Facebook. Just follow along on GFG! blog and Â comment below on your progress.  
Feel free to comment throughout the month on your progress. If you are having trouble making the challenge feel free to ask for suggestions and/or help.
