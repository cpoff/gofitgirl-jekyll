I took a yoga class at the gym today after work. It&#8217;s always nice to end the workweek with a yoga class.  
We had a sub today. Her class was a little different. It was a little more like &#8220;dance&#8221; yoga. We moved more to the music than to our own breath. But I did get warm pretty quick. So it was a beneficial yoga practice. And we got a pretty long [savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482), which was awesome.  
Once I got home Curt got home about 10 minutes after I did. He asked me if I wanted to hit McNally&#8217;s. It sounded like a good way to end a semi-crappy week.
