Tonight I tried Zumba for the very first time. My gym just started the class tonight. And it was a blast!  
I am not very coordinated, so a lot of classes like that are tough for me (I so suck at step). But since this was a brand new class Heidi started out pretty basic, which I still had a few issues with. But I got into it. Man, what a workout. I was sweaty, tired and had a lot of fun.  I plan on taking the class again.  
There was a lot of hip shaking&#8211;which works when you got the hips. There were a lot of other things shaking, too. HA!  
If you don&#8217;t know what Zumba is, you can watch [this short video](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/815970/zumba_workout/), which gives you a good idea.
