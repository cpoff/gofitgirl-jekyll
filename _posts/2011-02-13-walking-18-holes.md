This weekend Curt and I along with his parents, Ed and Marilyn, headed down to Monterey to watch family friend [Tag Ridings](http://www.pgatour.com/players/02/34/97/) play some golf.  
On Friday we watched him play at [Spyglass Hill](http://www.pebblebeach.com/golf/spyglass-hill-golf-course). We walked 16 of the 18 holes. We took a break for lunch and we decided to not walk the major hilly part.  
On Saturday Tag played the [Pebble Beach course](http://www.pebblebeach.com/). He started on the 10th hole. So we walked in and met him to see him tee off. Since Tag started on 10 he ended on the 9th hole. We did a lot of walking yesterday. Luckily we were sort of his entourage and got to piggyback on a shuttle ride back with him and his wife, Brenda. That was really nice of them to let us tag along so we didn&#8217;t have to walk all the way back. My feet were pretty tired after two days of lots of hilly walking. I feel my buns of steal forming already.
