The past 11 days I worked out 11 times. I am pretty amazed by that.  
I wasn&#8217;t able to work out today. Had some work stuff going on and then a memorial service to attend.  
But at my yoga class yesterday I was able to do a pose I have never had the guts to do until yesterday.  
You start out in [downward dog](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/491). Then you create the twist and third you flip the leg, which until yesterday I was too afraid to do. I haven&#8217;t gotten to the full pose of Upward Bow Pose. Â [See the steps here](http://www.yogastudio.org/teachings/downwarddog_demos.shtml).  
The amazing thing about yoga is you always have room for improvement in a pose. You can get deeper from breath and practice. You would think a basic Downward Facing Dog would be easy to &#8220;master.&#8221; But after almost four years of practicing yoga regularly I am still learning about my own body and of my practice.  
The best thing about yoga is the non-competitive nature of the practice.
