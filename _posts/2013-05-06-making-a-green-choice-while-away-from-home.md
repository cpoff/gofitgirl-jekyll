    I made a green choice when I checked into my Dallas hotel.
  </p>
</div>

  
When I checked into my hotel in Dallas on Friday evening I was given a choice to decline regular house keeping for environmental reasons.  
There is a reward of points to decline. Frankly, I don&#8217;t need points to agree to that.  
I don&#8217;t make my bed every day. And I don&#8217;t need anyone else making it.  
(A note: I do make my bed when we have company over. I don&#8217;t want people thinking I am messy or anything. And I feel when you invite people to your home it should be clean and welcoming. But as a kid I had to make my bed every day so I guess this is my adult rebellion to not regularly make it. And, really, what&#8217;s the point?)  
And I really don&#8217;t need clean sheets on my bed every single day. I don&#8217;t do that at home. How many people do?  
At home we also don&#8217;t use a towel once and then throw in the hamper. So why have that when staying at a hotel?  
Wow, what a waste of so many resources with washing sheets and towels and replacing every single day.  
And with all of that washing things get worn out and have to be replaced more often.  
My usual practice when staying at a hotel is to not have the sheets replaced and only have the towels occasionally replaced.  
This is such an easy way to be environmentally friendly.
