For many of us in the United States we celebrate Thanksgiving today.  
I try to remember to be thankful and grateful every day in my life.  
And today  I am going to write about it.  
One of the [GFG! November Monthly Challenges](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/11/mc-nov-14/) is the jar project.  
Throughout the month I have been adding slips of paper every day to my mason jar (see picture to the left) with positive things I have experienced.  
Most of the things I have been grateful for this month have been small. But it&#8217;s the small and simple things that we sometimes forget about.  
Since this will be my last Thanksgiving in the Bay Area (as we are heading to [Portland in the new year](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/11/oregon/)) I thought I would focus today&#8217;s grateful/thankful list mostly on the Bay Area.  
(That doesn&#8217;t mean I am not grateful for my family and the friends who don&#8217;t live here and lots of other stuff. I am just getting nostalgic about leaving the Bay Area.)  
I am grateful/thankful for:

  * My GFG! readers, friends, supporters. (I know you guys will follow me wherever I go.)
  * My spin friends.
  * The yoga girls!
  * Sushiya (our favorite sushi place).
  * The Husband.
  * All of my amazing yoga teachers.
  * My amazing and close Bay Area friends. (I am lucky to have some amazing and supportive people in my life.)
  * My yoga students.
  * Gas only bring $3.07 when I filled up today.
  * Thanksgiving Day yoga (where the money goes to charity).
  * The awesome opportunity I was given to teach three regular yoga classes at a gym for months while the regular teacher was on maternity leave. I feel really lucky and grateful for this, especially as a new yoga teacher.
  * McNally&#8217;s (our favorite dive bar).
  * All of the amazing text messages I saw this morning as I was leaving Thanksgiving Day yoga. Thanks for the smiles, friends.
  * All of my Onyx friends.
  * Piedmont Yoga Studio.
  * My gym friends and others who were willing to let me teach a cycling class when the regular teacher didn&#8217;t show up. (I&#8217;m getting really good at this being bossy thing. Though, I will admit, it&#8217;s pretty natural.)
  * Namaste Yoga Studio.
  * Girl dates!
  * My yoga teacher training friends.
  * My hobby of knitting.
  * Restorative Yoga workshops.
  * The neighborhood I live in (Rockridge).
  * My yoga classes (where I am a student).
  * Cheesemas (and its inventors).
  * Cato&#8217;s (where the yoga girls go for drinks after yoga).

I hope everyone has a safe and warm Thanksgiving. And get ready to prepare yourselves for a crazy month ahead of us. There will be a December challenge to hopefully help everyone get through the crazy times and remind ourselves to take a breath and relax.
