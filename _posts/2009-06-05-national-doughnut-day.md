Apparently June 5, 2009 is [National Doughnut Day](http://www.washingtonian.com/blogarticles/restaurants/bestbites/12555.html)!  
A co-worker brought in doughnuts from Krispy Kreme. I grabbed one and scarfed it down. I barely even remember eating those empty calories. HA!  
Oh well. At least I celebrated this wonderful holiday. ðŸ™‚
