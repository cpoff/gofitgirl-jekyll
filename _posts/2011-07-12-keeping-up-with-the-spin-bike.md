    My results from my "great ride" today doing intervals.
  </p>
</div>

  
Today was Day No. 21 in a row of me doing some form of exercise. I believe you should take at least one day off each week to break from exercise. I don&#8217;t feel like I have been going overboard and I feel good with my workouts.  
I know Thursday I won&#8217;t be hitting the gym or the yoga studio as we have friends in town for one night only and I want to see them. So I will get my break then. (And probably take in a ton of calories, too.)  
Today at the work gym I did an interval spin on the espinner. It&#8217;s a great routine as you get a variety of training on the bike: climbing; sprinting; jumps; endurance; hills &#8230;  
I was so dreading exercising today. I debated on whether I wanted to do spin or yoga. And I really didn&#8217;t want to do either. I went with the spin as it was easier to get it over with while still at work then come home and still have to convince myself to go to the studio.  
It was a tough workout. But it was good. And I am glad I did it &#8230; at least I felt that way after the 53 minutes were over!
