My abs class was on Saturday and today is Tuesday &#8230; and my abs are still sore. Today it only hurts when I laugh, cough or sneeze. But man.  
My whole entire ab area is sore&#8211;never had that before. I looked up a [sketch of the muscle ab area](http://www.the-fitness-motivator.com/images/absbig.jpg), click if you are interested. This is a good sore, but still.  
Today and yesterday in spin I could even feel my sore abs as I was riding. Now I know that spin can work the abs, too.
