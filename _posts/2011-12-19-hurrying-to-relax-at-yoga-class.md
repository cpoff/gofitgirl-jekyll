    We did a lot of work with the bolster tonight. And supported Child's Pose was one of them. http://www.laughinglotus.com/

I literally ran to the yoga studio tonight to make it on time to Baxter&#8217;s Hatha class.  
Traffic from South City to Emeryville was pretty tame, especially since there is a 49ers game tonight. But from Emeryville a drive in the evenings that normally takes me 15-20 minutes took 40 minutes tonight.  
I quickly changed into my yoga clothes once I got home and headed out to Namaste. I ran part of the way and when I arrived I was pretty much out of breath and quite warm.  
But I made it on time. And I have to say I am glad I did. I always enjoy Baxter&#8217;s classes. I was hoping for more of a Christmas-themed class. There were some Grinch and Christmas Rack references. Eh, good enough.  
That class is never too intense. But tonight was even more mellow and we did a lot of work with the bolster. Oh yea, so nice! I love working with the bolster.  
It was so worth running and hurrying to class to relax &#8230;
