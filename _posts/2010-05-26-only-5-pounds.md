So I have about 5 pounds to lose to be back at my goal weight.  
My husband was sweet and mentioned to me the other day that I looked good. Thanks, honey. But I do need to lose 5 pounds.  
Most people think 5 pounds isn&#8217;t a big deal. Or they roll their eyes at me. Or even tell me they hate me. (I did work very hard to lose 30 pounds a few years ago.) But here&#8217;s the thing, yea, 5 pounds isn&#8217;t a lot to lose. But if I continue to eat the way I have been eating lately that 5 pounds is gonna become 10, 15 &#8230; You get the idea. So it is best and easiest to tackle the weight when it isn&#8217;t a lot.  
So that is my goal right now: Get back to my goal weight. Some of my pants are a little tight&#8211;and it would be nice if they fit a little better.  
Today is Day 3 of eating healthier. And I am doing well. Today my work out was in my work building gym. I did some weight machines for arms and legs; free weights for arms; squats; a little more than 10-minute brisk walk on the treadmill. That was about an hour work out. And I am feeling a little sore &#8230; good sore.
