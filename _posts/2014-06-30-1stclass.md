Yesterday afternoon I taught my first yoga class as a certified yoga teacher.  
After completing my 10-month teacher training program I planned a trip to Tucson to visit family, get in a little relax time at the [Arizona Inn](http://arizonainn.com) and to teach my first yoga class.  
My class was called Do Good While You Feel Good at Hilda&#8217;s studio, [Mindful Yoga Studio](http://www.mindfulyogatucson.com). All proceeds are going to [Tucson&#8217;s Food Bank](http://communityfoodbank.com).  
I had 12 students total, including Hilda and my dad.  
A few of the students were invited by me, many were Hilda&#8217;s regulars and there was one couple who found the class by looking up a class that fit in their schedule. Plus they liked the idea of the donation class.  
As I am not a huge fan talking in front of a group of people (talk about taking myself out of my comfort zone) I was super nervous as the class began.  
But eventually I felt comfortable and at ease. I felt confident in what and how I was teaching.  
The class seemed to respond well to me, my humor, my class and my style. I just kept things simple and I was just who I am.  
I received a lot of great feedback and plan to continue to grow and improve my teaching.  
I will be teaching at [Piedmont Yoga Studio](http://www.piedmontyoga.com) in Oakland, CA, on July 24 with my friend Sandra as part of the 2013/2014 Deep Yoga graduate Summer Series. See [Facebook invite here](https://www.facebook.com/events/698724470163134/?source=3&source_newsfeed_story_type=regular).  
As I start subbing and teaching classes and along with setting up one-one-one sessions I will make updates on Go Fit Girl&#8217;s [My Yoga Classes page](http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/).
