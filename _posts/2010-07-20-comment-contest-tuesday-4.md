OK, gang, it&#8217;s time for Comment Contest Tuesday.  
I would like to do more research for Go Fit Girl! Instead of always just writing about my own personal experiences I would like to try to explore down the road of a little research. But I need your help for that.  
What I want to hear from you is, what do you want me to write about?  Is there a subject you would like researched? Do you want to know more about a certain type of exercise? You can even ask me direct questions. Was there a Go Fit Girl! guest blogger you would like to hear a follow-up from?  
To participate in Comment Contest Tuesday answer the above request in the comments below. You can comment as much as you like. The comment has to be relevant to the actual request. For every time you individually (one comment per reply) comment your name will be thrown into a hat three times. Up to three comments will be counted. So you could have your name in the drawing a total of nine times. Just make sure each comment is in its own reply. Does that make sense? I just don&#8217;t want people writing the three comments all in the same reply&#8211;I can&#8217;t always tell if I should count those once or more than once. Winner and prize will be announced on Tuesday or Wednesday. You have a whole week to come up with stuff.  
You have until next Tuesday at noon (my time) to comment away. You have to comment in the comments on Go Fit Girl! I won’t accept e-mails, comments on Facebook, etc.  
Good luck!
