I meant to post about this last Wednesday. But that work thing is getting in the way of my blogging.  
Last Wednesday I attended my regular yoga class. We had a new person in the class. He wasn&#8217;t a typical yogi. He was a big guy, kinda beefy and looked like he lifted big weights.  
This guy pushed through the class and seemed to be humbled by it.  
I was proud of him. I wanted to tell him so, but I didn&#8217;t want to embarrass him.  
Today yoga class was focused on twists. Who knew that could be a great workout? It felt really great on my back.
