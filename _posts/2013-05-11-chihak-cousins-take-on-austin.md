I spent 5-6 days in Dallas for an international trademark conference.  
I allowed myself to enjoy food and drink. And boy, did I. The day I arrived and Day 2 I hit the gym at the end of the day.  
And then the gym time went down hill after that. Late nights, early mornings and long days &#8230; There were days I had a few hours for a break in between meetings, sessions and dinners and I chose a nap over the gym.  
I left Dallas on Thursday and headed to Austin to meet up with my cousin Alex, who used to live here. He and I have been excited about this trip for months.  
So far the eating and drinking is going great&#8211;as in, I am eating a lot of delicious food and drinking a lot of beer. I even tried moonshine yesterday. Check goes on the bucket list.  
I did hit the gym this morning and plan to tomorrow before I take off as well.  
And Monday I will get back to my healthy lifestyle routine.  
But the reason for this post is that even though Alex and I were only in Austin together for a short period of time it was a great bonding experience. In the past many years Alex and I have gotten close and have each other&#8217;s back. I am so happy to have our cousin/friend relationship grow over the years.  
There is something cheesy on Facebook I have seen about how your cousins are your first friends. And, wow, that is so true. Here&#8217;s the quote: Cousins are your very first friends &#8230; They are like childhood friends. Nobody will understand the craziness of your family better than your cousins.  
Thanks, cousin, for joining me. Let&#8217;s meet here again soon.
