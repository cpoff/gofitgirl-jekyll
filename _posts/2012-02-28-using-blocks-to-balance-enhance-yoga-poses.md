    My usual props for my practice. Tonight we used two blocks, a strap and a blanket.

Tonight in Vickie&#8217;s Hatha yoga class we focused on using blocks for many of our poses.  
I struggle with balancing poses. Standing on a block made it a little easier to focus my weight and core to keep myself upright or balanced.  
We practiced Downward Facing Dog on blocks. [First with the blocks under our hands](http://yogaforrunners.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/downward-facing-dog.jpg) and then with [the blocks under our feet](http://www.prajnayoga.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Spackman-022.jpg).  
We also practiced [Triangle Pose](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YUUcsK3zr9Q/TWWLL34H9FI/AAAAAAAAAPU/3u656-KEhrY/s320/Triangle_Block.jpg) standing on a block with a transition to [Half Moon Pose](http://appleturnover.tv/homemade/images/halfmoon-l.jpg). (For these poses I can&#8217;t seem to find an example of someone also placing a block under their feet. But you get the idea.)  
For me, [Tree Pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/media/originals/HP_MAR06_Vrksasana_248.jpg) was the most interesting on the block. Sometimes this pose is pretty steady and not so challenging. But most of the time I struggle to keep my balance and not teeter or fall out of the pose. (Sorry, no sample of that pose on the block.)  
I love when we do a practice a little different or do the same practice with an adjustment.
