    Limiting my caffeine intake the past few days has helped me adapt to the time change.

For many years I write a post when we Spring Forward and Fall Back and I give advice and tips on how to prepare before the change and things to do after.  
(Here&#8217;s [last week&#8217;s post](http://gofitgirl.com/2016/03/springforward/) with tips to prepare to Spring Forward.)  
I usually follow some of my advice. But not all of it.  
This year I decided it would be best to follow my own advice, especially since I have such a difficult time with the time change.  
And I actually went beyond.  
This is the first year I have felt pretty OK with the time change. And I think it&#8217;s because I changed things up a little this year.

  * I am &#8220;off the sauce&#8221; as The Husband says. I have taken a little time off drinking&#8211;to prepare for what is coming up in Vegas this week/weekend.
  * I only had one cup of coffee Saturday, Sunday, Monday and this morning. (Even though a second cup sounded awesome.) It&#8217;s been cold. I&#8217;ve been having more tea lately.
  * I&#8217;ve been staying hydrated with regular old fashioned water and a little coconut water thrown into the mix.
  * I didn&#8217;t take any naps over the weekend.
  * Saturday morning I woke up a little earlier than usual and did a morning yoga practice. Because I teach at 8:30 Saturday mornings I normally skip the home practice.
  * Saturday night I started getting ready for bed about 9. Getting ready entails brushing teeth, washing face, etc. and then some time reading before I hit the sack.
  * Sunday morning I did my morning yoga home practice before heading out to teach my cycle class.
  * I&#8217;ve been trying to keep my meals healthy and filling, which is the norm.
  * Sunday night I got ready for bed a little later than Saturday night. But still with enough time to get a good night&#8217;s rest.
  * Yesterday (Monday) morning did my home yoga practice before heading out to teach cycle class. No nap Monday afternoon, which has been happening during the week a little more often than I would like.
  * Monday afternoon I did a Restorative Yoga practice in the middle of the day between classes.
  * Last night after teaching a class and this morning I took yoga classes. I love being a yoga student. It doesn&#8217;t happen often enough.

I did sleep in today. But it&#8217;s my day off. And sleeping in means waking up at about 6 or so, falling back asleep until 7:45. It&#8217;s unusual for me to sleep that late.  
I&#8217;m glad I followed my advice and then some. Surviving the time change will be easier for me in the future.
