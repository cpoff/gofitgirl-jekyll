I am either coming down with a cold or allergies. But I am leaning toward allergies. When I lived in Arizona my worst allergy attacks were in the summer or when I was around loose hay.  
And it has been summer here lately. High 90s yesterday and today.  
Regardless I am taking a break from the gym. I am a little bummed about it. But I just don&#8217;t think it is a good idea. I am already pretty tired these days and am slightly congested and have a scratchy throat.
