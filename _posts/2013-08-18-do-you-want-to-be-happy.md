    Curt and I were recently in Turks & Caicos. Hard work along with certain decisions and sacrifices have allowed us to be able to travel.

As much as I hate to admit this I used to watch Dr. Phil.  
His famous line (at least with me) was, Do you want to be right or do you want to be married?  
I realize he was trying to keep the peace in a relationship. But damnit, sometimes you just want to be right!  
Eventually his ego and attitude irritated me and I stopped watching.  
But what I took from his question was, do you want to be happy?  
Let&#8217;s be realistic. Circumstances, education, basic survival among other major things can be reasons why happiness is not a priority.  
And, obviously, we can&#8217;t be happy all day every day (stole that quote from Charlotte from Sex and the City movie).  
Recently I have been looking at things in my life and making some decisions and choices and evaluations.  
Basically I am happy. But I continue to work and strive for more. I am working to make myself content and happy and to be fulfilled.  
When looking at your own life and figuring out what you can and can&#8217;t realistically change you can&#8217;t compare your life to others. Never assume someone else&#8217;s life is perfect.  
Look into yourself and decide what you need to change and go for it.  
I feel lucky and fortunate to be where I am in life right now. I could list all the things I haven&#8217;t accomplished or the struggles I have had and continue to have.  
I have worked hard for what I have. And a lot of it was a struggle. My life looks perfect to many because I make things look easy. But it has been and is nothing but easy.  
Do you want to be happy? What are you doing to make No. 1 happy, content and fulfilled?
