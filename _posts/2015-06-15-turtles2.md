It&#8217;s been a journey. But it&#8217;s finally here, the opening of [Turtles Yoga & Wellness](http://www.turtlesyoga.com)Â is today!  
I am so excited to be part of the Turtles team.  
My current teaching schedule at Turtles is:

  * **Mondays**, 5:45-7 p.m. (Gentle)
  * **Thursdays**, 7-8:30 p.m. (Hatha alignment)
