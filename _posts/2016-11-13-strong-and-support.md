> **Things falling apart is a kind of testing and also a kind of healing. We think that the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don&#8217;t really get solved. The come together and they fall apart. They they come together again and fall apart again. It&#8217;s just like that. The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen: room for grief, for relief, for misery, for joy.**

We are stronger together. I truly believe that.  
I have been taking the past few days to reflect and think about the election, the results and what it all means and how I feel about it. I&#8217;ve been collecting and gathering my thoughts and feelings.

    In my yoga classes this week I&#8217;m sharing love, kindness, compassion, comfort, acceptance and hugs.

I cried a lot on Wednesday. I am still so very sad, heartbroken, in shock and disbelief, angry &#8230;  
As a woman I feel as I do; as a Mexican American I feel as I do; as a feminist I feel as I do; as a human being I feel as I do; as someone who was raised to love everyone I feel as I do &#8230;  
As I&#8217;ve been teaching my yoga classes this week, while wearing my pearls as a sign of support and silent and peaceful protest and since Friday wearing a safety pin, I am giving love, compassion, kindness, acceptance, love and hugs. I am allowing my students to feel what they feel and, as always, honoring their bodies.  
I believe that one of the greatest things about America is our melting pot. Our melting pot of colors, cultures, beliefs, religions, differences and ideas.  
This isn&#8217;t about politics. This is about human decency.  
So many people are afraid about differences. Someone being strong doesn&#8217;t make someone else weak.  
We can all be strong and support each other.  
I do believe we should mourn Hillary Rodham Clinton&#8217;s loss as she stood for so many. And we all mourn in different ways.  
But whenever we are ready we need to take the opportunity to show our strength and use our energy in positive ways. Because we are stronger together!  
Those of us who believe in equality we are not backing down. I plan to be more involved and active.  
I have very strong feelings toward Donald Trump. This isn&#8217;t about Trump bashing. What I will state is the truth. Donald Trump is not a true Republican or conservative. He made hate speech mainstream and acceptable. He incited violence. He said ugly things about women, Muslims, people with disabilities, people who questioned him, Mexicans, the press, immigrants, LGBTQIA, etc.  
Hate speech is not OK. It&#8217;s never OK. Violence is not OK, especially in the passion of hate. But this is most especially not OK if you are the president of the United States.  
I will continue to be the person I am by showing love, compassion, understanding, acceptance, safety and comfort to all. As long as you show respect to me I&#8217;ll show respect to you.  
For every woman who has been passed over for a promotion because she is a woman, not taken seriously because she is a woman, been groped or talked to inappropriately because she is a woman, made less money because she is a woman, been mansplained to because she is a women, been interrupted because she is a woman &#8230;  
I truly believe that Hillary Rodham Clinton was the most qualified candidate to ever run for president. And let&#8217;s face it, Trump was the least qualified ever. That is a major reason this hurts so much for me.  
Women have been fighting for so long. Doing our best, working our hardest, giving our all and not being taken seriously &#8230; it&#8217;s real and painful and happens regularly, which is a real shame.  
I truly thought HRC was going to win and be the next president of the United States.  
This just means we have more fighting to do, more work to do, the battle isn&#8217;t over &#8230; yet.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  I end my yoga classes by saying: <strong><em>Keep peace in the mind &#8230; Strength in the body &#8230; And love in the heart. Namaste.</em></strong>
