For a while now I have known that I needed to lose some weight. Not a lot. I figured about 5 pounds.  
This morning I weighed myself on a very reliable scale and was shocked at the number. It is really more like 10 pounds that I need to lose.  
A couple of those pounds could be water retention. Over the weekend I didn&#8217;t drink enough water, drank more (as in alcohol) than normal and Curt and I had pepperoni pizza last night. The pepperoni was kinda salty.  
But still, the lesson here is that I need to get control back over my eating habits. My exercise habits are still pretty good.  
I will keep you updated on how I am progressing on getting back to my goal weight.
