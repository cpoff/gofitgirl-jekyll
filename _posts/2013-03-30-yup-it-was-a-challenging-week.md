Well, what a week &#8230;  
I knew this past week would pose some challenges in the caloric intake department with food and booze and also with my regular exercise routine.  
What I didn&#8217;t count on was getting sick &#8230; AGAIN.  
Tuesday morning when I woke up I was exhausted. And I slept decently.  
I felt the cold forming in my chest and was worried that this one was gonna be a doozy.  
Lucky for me &#8230; I didn&#8217;t get a full blown cold, which is what happened a few weeks ago.  
Even with multiple eating and drinking fests I had a plan to keep my exercise regular.  
But when I am sick I don&#8217;t exercise as I feel it is important and necessary for me to focus my energy on getting back to being healthy.  
This means I didn&#8217;t get to work on my planks and push-ups for March&#8217;s Monthly Challenge. In just a week I was able to master an 80-second plank. Imagine what I could have done had I worked on that a little more.  
I feel almost back to normal today. But I made a decision to make sure that I am 100% healthy before getting back to the exercise.  
There was pretty much no blogging this week as I pretty much came home each night and vegged on the couch or just zonked out. But GFG! got all kinds of ideas to post about including April&#8217;s Monthly Challenge.  
So back to the exercise routine on Monday. And that means a loungy weekend for me.  
I am anxious to get back to my healthy routine with both exercise and food/drink.
