    Going for a walk on the treadmill while rocking on to some tunes.

I didn&#8217;t get down to the work gym until about 4:20 or so. Twenty minutes later than I really wanted.  
(Lately it is more difficult to get down to the gym at 4 and get in an almost 90-minute workout.)  
I really wanted to focus on weights and abs today. But I also wanted to do a little cardio. And I really didn&#8217;t think I could do an hour of weights and abs. Though I bet I could have.  
I walked on the treadmill for about 20 minutes&#8211;1 mile and about 100 calories. After that I did about 30 minutes of weights, medicine ball and squats and some abs.  
It was nice not to have to feel rushed while doing arms, squats and abs. I did a lot more weights for my arms than I normally do.  
Hopefully I will feel my hard work tomorrow.  
Oh man, it&#8217;s 9 p.m. Gotta start getting ready for bed and finish my dinner &#8230; a glass of wine. Yup, one of those days and nights. And I just didn&#8217;t have time or energy to make dinner. (Last night I had a bowl of cereal.) My evenings seem to get shorter and shorter &#8230;
