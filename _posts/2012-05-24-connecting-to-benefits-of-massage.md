As I have mentioned in recent posts work has been exhausting and overwhelming lately.  
So today after work I treated myself to a massage. I have been going to [Bellissima Day Spa](http://www.bellissimaberkeley.com/home/) for seven years. And probably for the past 3-4 years Thanh has been taking care of me.  
And Thanh does an awesome job of taking care of me. She does amazing work with her hands and I can tell she cares about me.  
We chat a lot during most appointments (though I don&#8217;t like to chat while getting a massage) and I always get a hug before I leave.  
I noticed she changed things up a bit today. Sometimes Thanh will ask me how I am or what is going on and that helps her determine the type if work she will rub into my knots and muscles.  
I have never been disappointed with Thanh&#8217;s work. And today was no exception.  
I actually feel asleep briefly a few times. I don&#8217;t want to miss out on enjoying the massage during it so I don&#8217;t want to fall asleep. But I was really tired.  
This [Mayo Clinic article](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/massage/sa00082) states some of the many benefits of massage:

  * Stress relief
  * Managing anxiety and depression
  * Pain
  * Stiffness
  * Blood pressure control
  * Infant growth
  * Sports-related injuries
  * Boosting immunity
  * Cancer treatment

The article also states that massage creates deep connections with their massage therapist. I like that and I feel that this is true.  
I left feeling like a noodle in Jell-O. And hours later I am still feeling noodle-like. Oh yea!
