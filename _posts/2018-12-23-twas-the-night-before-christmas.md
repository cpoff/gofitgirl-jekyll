  T’was the night before Christmas, I needed to chill,<br />So I got on my mat, and I got very still.<br />The bills I had racked loomed large in my head<br />I’d done it again, despite what I’d said<br />To myself—I had promised this year I’d try harder<br />I’d try very hard to be fiscally smarter.<br />As I moved into down dog, I breathed in the air<br />Filled with pine from the Christmas tree standing downstairs,<br />And the lingering scent of the dinner I made<br />Of brown rice and mung beans (which nobody ate),<br />And I gazed at my navel and vowed to ignore<br />The dirt and detritus littering the floor<br />The pine needles, the dog hair and discarded clothes<br />The thing the cat left not an inch from my nose.<br />I moved out of dog and saluted the sun<br />The negatives dropping away one by one.<br />I soared into half moon, feeling strong now<br />I reached and I stretched and I twisted and bowed.<br />My body got warm and my mind became clear—<br />Then I remembered what I’m doing here.<br />In my imperfect house, with it’s dusty knick knacks<br />Filled with unruly children eating unhealthy snacks<br />In my imperfect body, aging each day<br />And my imperfect mind which won’t do what I say,<br />I’m living my life here breath by breath<br />Savoring each moment I have before death.<br />Remember, remember, I tell myself<br />Be nice and be kind and be soft with yourself.<br />You don’t get unlimited Christmases, you know,<br />So enjoy this one and then let it go.<br />As I settled into my last resting pose,<br />And I let the air in and back out of my nose,<br />I felt light and clean and I knew all was well,<br />Because yoga, again, had cast its still spell.<br />~Unknown
