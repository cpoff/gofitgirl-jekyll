    For some of my indoor cycling classes this past week I planned a playlist on Spotify to pay tribute to some of the artists we lost in 2016.

Today is the last day of 2016.  
I know many are saying good riddance to this year. But really, why?  
There are some things that happened this year that I am not happy with. But many great things happened this year as well.  
And we can&#8217;t have joy without suffering and we can&#8217;t have suffering without joy.  
And I truly believe that everything we experience good and bad make us who we are today. So on Dec. 31, 2017 we will look back and see what has changed (good and bad) and how we have changed over the past year.  
As we all are well aware many celebrities died this year. Their deaths stand out more because they are celebrities.  
But many people lost someoneÂ this year who they really loved and cared about. Whether a parent, spouse, friend, child, grandparent, sibling, etc.  
I&#8217;m not discounting your feelings toward a celebrity whose music meant something to you when you were an awkward teenager and needed someone to relate to or a fabulous actress or actor who really spoke to you or an author who got into your imagination and made the words from the pages real in your own mind/imagination or &#8230;  
Probably the biggest celebrity loss for me is George Michael. But I will be honest. I am not heartbroken or devastated. But yea, it&#8217;s a bummer.  
I remember as a kid watching Friday Night Videos (remember those?) dancing and singing along with George and that other guy from Wham! thinking &#8220;yup, George, you are my man.&#8221;  
In the end we all die. Some sooner than we think is time. But when we go, it&#8217;s our time. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t make sense, it&#8217;s not fair, it hurts a lot.  
Many look at a new year as a clean slate.  
I received a newsletter from one of my former yoga teachers reminding us to face 2017 with courage.  
Also, please remember to be kind to yourself and to others.  
First limb of yoga is YAMA: Our morals and ethical standards and our behavior toward others.  
Second limb of yoga is NIYAMA: Our treatment of and our attitudes toward ourselves.  
Let&#8217;s welcome 2017 with peace, love, compassion, kindness, acceptance, honor and patience for ourselves first and, of course, to others as well.  
Happy New Year!
