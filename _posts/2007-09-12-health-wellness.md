Yesterday Onyx hosted a Health & Wellness Expo. I was a volunteer. I made a board giving info on WW and printed out information for people to read and take.  
  
I also greeted vendors in the lobby and had them escorted to the third floor. We had a really good variety of vendors come in, including: YMCA; Delta Dental; Maverick&#8217;s Gym (the gym I work out at); REI; Emeryville firefighter to check blood pressure&#8211;mine was pretty good; Breathe California to check lung capacity&#8211;I was at 88%&#8211;very good; free chair massages; MHN, TLC, Blue Cross, etc.  
We had a healthy and really yummy lunch catered by Whole Foods. I attended a couple of really good breakout sessions. At the end of the expo there was a raffle. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t win anything. But there were some pretty cool prizes.
