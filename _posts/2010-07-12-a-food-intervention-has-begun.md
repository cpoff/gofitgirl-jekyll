My caloric intake has been out of control lately. I have got to stop eating the way I have been lately or I am gonna have to buy bigger pants. And I don&#8217;t want that. (There has been lots of eating out, lots of bad food choices.)  
So today I got back to healthier and much more &#8220;normal&#8221; eating. No high calorie snacks or meals. I did hit Starbucks for a [Caramel Light Frappuccino](http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks). But that was my only splurge for the day.  
Also today I hit the noon spin class. Mondays are always tough. But taking a break to exercise and build some endorphins is always a good thing.
