          The espinner virtual instructor reminds me to drink my water.

      <br /> Today I rode the espinner at the work gym. I did about 45 minutes of climbing. The virtual instructor (I have yet to figure out his name) reminded me many times to drink water. In regular classes with a live instructor usually the teacher will remind you to drink water. I personally don&#8217;t need to be reminded. I need that water as much as I need a towel to wipe off my sweat.

Go Fit Girl! explored water intake for a majority of the posts last week. It seems pretty simple, drink a decent amount of water, stay hydrated and you will receive many great benefits.  
I talked about how on average I drink 80 ounces of water a day, which is 10 servings. My doctor had told me if I drank about 60 ounces a day she would be happy with that.  
According to [this article from the Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283) you should drink about 64 ounces of water a day. Also known as the 8X8 rule.  
Is it possible to drink too much water?  
According to [About.com](http://chemistry.about.com/cs/5/f/blwaterintox.htm), drinking too much water is called water intoxication. The kidneys of a healthy adult can process 15 liters of water a day. (If I did my math correctly, and it is possible that I didn&#8217;t, 15 liters of water is about 510 ounces of water, which is about 64 servings of water.) That&#8217;s a lot of water!  
According to [Wikipedia, water intoxication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication), also known as hyper-hydration, water poisoning, or overhydration, is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain functions that results when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is pushed outside of safe limits by over-consumption of water.  
I don&#8217;t  think any of us are in jeopardy of drinking too much water or having water intoxication.  
Keep hydrated!
