    This is me in front of the Pope Mobile in Germany in June 2006 just a few months before I went on Weight Watchers.

I used to be considered skinny. I hate that term. To me it has a negative connotation.  
According to [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skinny), skinny means lacking sufficient flesh, very thin, emaciated; lacking usual or desirable bulk, quantity, qualities or significance.  
But it seems like so many of us strive to be skinny. Why is that? Why do we think [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2T3IC0mfVGU/TaSBVKp2_ZI/AAAAAAAAAF8/tEfXGYn90Vk/s1600/skinny_model.jpg) looks better than [this](http://healthybodyguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/body_ls.jpg)?  
So here is the skinny on skinny &#8230;  
A skinny person can have a high metabolism. So they think they can eat anything they want and they won&#8217;t gain weight. (That used to be me. I could eat or drink pretty much whatever I wanted and not gain weight.) But that doesn&#8217;t mean that skinny person is healthy.  
Have you heard the term skinny fat? [Skinny fat](http://www.glamourunderground.com/551/skinny-thin-high-body-fat-percentage/) means a person looks thin but has a high body fat percentage. That can be dangerous.  
Someone who ingests a lot of fat and calories and carbohydrates can have health issues. Someone who eats too much fat can be at [risk for heart disease](http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/002468sid.htm). Too many carbs can contribute to conditions such as Type 2 Diabetes, [according to Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/508484-what-happens-when-someone-eats-too-many-carbs/).  
When the wellness program started at work the first thing we did to launch it was to have our numbers checked: blood pressure; active lifestyle heart rate; glucose; cholesterol; Body Mass Index (BMI); and waist to height ratio (WHtR).  
My numbers were pretty much in the desirable/healthy range. My blood pressure was a little high. After I got my results I sat down with a nurse to discuss my results. She told me because the rest of my numbers were so great that she wasn&#8217;t concerned with the blood pressure, especially since it wasn&#8217;t really high&#8211;just at the cusp of it. (And because a pin prick was involved and any sort of needle scares me it probably raised my blood pressure a little.)

  <a href="http://gofitgirl.com/2012/07/skinny-doesnt-mean-healthy/thinner/" rel="attachment wp-att-9538"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9538" title="thinner" src="http://gofitgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/thinner-300x218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" /></a>

    Here I am showing off the 30+ pounds I lost in the same outfit I wore in front of the Pope Mobile about a year before. I am thinner here, but not skinny.

The reason my numbers are so good is because I eat healthy (the nurse told me she could tell I did with my low cholesterol numbers) and I exercise regularly. (Genes can help as well.)  
She also told my body type (pear shape) is the healthiest body type. [According to a study done in the UK](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-01-12/entertainment/17943305_1_pear-shaped-people-apple-shape-fat), having more weight or fat or whatever you want to call it in the butt/hips/thigh area (than the waist) suggests some extra protection against diabetes, heart disease and other health problems associated with obesity. Dr. Robert Kushner, a professor medicine specializing in obesity at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said belly fat is dangerous because, &#8220;it is more metabolically active.&#8221;  
A healthy lifestyle keeps all foods in moderation. We need fat, we need calories, we need carbohydrates, we need protein &#8230; But we need all of these in moderation. Too much or too little of anything can be bad for our bodies.  
And we also need exercise.  
I like to eat and I like to drink. I am willing to keep the majority of it in moderation. But I still like to splurge and eat out and enjoy my food. But I know my limitations and that I need to exercise.  
And I know I want to stay healthy and keep my weight manageable, my cholesterol and blood pressure in check as well as my glucose. Type 2 Diabetes runs on both sides of my family. So staying healthy is important for me.
