    Don't forget to "fall back" tomorrow.
  </p>

Tomorrow very early (2 a.m.) we fall back. I hate falling back or springing forward. The time change completely wreaks havoc on my body&#8211;physically and mentally.  
You would think one hour wouldn&#8217;t be a big deal. But for some reason it is. (Being from Arizona I never dealt with time change until I first moved to Oregon at 23.)  
During the week I wake up to an alarm, which goes off at 5 a.m. so sleeping in for me is about 6:30. Sundays tend to be my lazy day, so let&#8217;s hope I can stay asleep a little longer than normal, especially tomorrow.  
I have found that the best way to deal with the time change is to make sure I exercise. When we sprang forward in March that Monday was a rough day for me. I made sure to make it to my regular noon spin class even though I was tired and really didn&#8217;t want to go. I felt like a different and new person as I walked out after class and a shower.  
No matter how tired or wacked out you are tomorrow try to do something active: take a walk, take a yoga class (that&#8217;s what I will be doing); go play with your friends; take a hike (though I think here in the Bay Area we will be welcoming some rain &#8230;). And continue with the physical activity through the week as well.  
Exercise helps me with time change and jetlag and really anything that take a toll on me physically and/or mentally.
