Most of my posts lately have been about this crappy cold I have. Well, enough already, right? Yea, that&#8217;s what I am thinking. (But it ain&#8217;t over yet.)  
This cold started Christmas night and still lingers. On Friday the cold moved to my chest.  
The congestion in my head and nose is almost gone. But I have this annoying cough. I have tried so many different kind of medicines. I am thinking the Mucinex in liquid form is the best medicine so far. And the kinda yucky tasting generic honey lemon cough drops work pretty well.  
The past few nights I have slept horribly because I wake up numerous times hacking like a maniac. At some point last night I grabbed an extra pillow from the spare room to prop myself up. I am not sure if it actually worked. (I plan to try three pillows tonight.)  
I did a little research today to see if I could find anything to help with my cough, especially while I am trying to sleep (as is The Husband).  
According to this [eHow article: How to Ease a Cough](http://www.ehow.com/how_5279_ease-cough.html) I am pretty much following all the advice. I have been drinking lots of water and hot tea (with honey). I am taking various cough medicines to help control cough and to also help loosen and expel the lovely mucus. I am sucking on icky cough lozenges.  
Even though this isn&#8217;t mentioned I have also been trying to stay on the healthy track with food. Lots of fruits and veggies. For dinner tonight we will be having grilled chicken breast and a side of veggies. I have cut out alcohol and soda. I am pretty much just drinking water and tea.  
This [article on WebMD, Sleep Better When You&#8217;re Sick](http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/features/sleep-better-when-you-are-sick), tells you how to sleep better when you are sick. The information I was really looking for was this: Elevate your head to ease sinus pressure and make breathing less cumbersome. A sleep expert said, replace your pillow with a foam bed wedge. If that&#8217;s not possible, stack your pillows so that you create a wedge, with at least some lift under your shoulders, increasing elevation as you go toward your head.  
Some advice on [Ask Alice](http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2367.html) gives some general things that can help quiet a cough, including:

  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        keeping the bedroom humidified (using a cold-air vaporizer, for example)
      </li>
      <li>
        drinking lots of fluids — enough to keep urine colorless and odorless — to help liquefy th<var id="yiv962347326yui-ie-cursor"></var>e mucus, making it easier to cough up
      </li>
      <li>
        drinking hot liquids or eating soup
      </li>
      <li>
        sucking on cough drops or hard candy to soothe a tickly throat (maybe before you try sleeping)
      </li>
      <li>
        propping up on pillows or sleeping on 2 or 3 pillows to help ease post-nasal drip, thus minimizing the need to clear your throat
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

Let&#8217;s hope between the NyQuil, my propped pillows, healthy dinner, maybe some hot tea and an early bedtime I will get this cough under control and get a good night&#8217;s sleep.
