Thank you to everyone who participated in last week&#8217;s [Comment Contest Tuesday](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9943).  
I asked my readers to tell me why they read or like Go Fit Girl! If they were a first-time reader, I asked them to feel free to mention what they would like to learn or what they hope to get out of reading this blog.  
I was overwhelmed at what my readers/friends had to say. I am humbled by the many kind and genuine comments.  
And the main theme seemed to be that I am real and realistic. That truly means a lot to me. I am just a regular person trying to survive life and all of its challenges and I share that along with my research with my readers.  
The first three readers who commented were guaranteed to win a bag. Those winners are: Alicia, Monica and Jen.  
The next five bags went to the next five commenters: Jen, Nicole, Jeremy, Gail and Nicole. (Yup, I got two friends and readers named Jen and Nicole.)  
There were eight bags total. So no drawing was required and everyone who commented won a bag.  
Some of the amazing things my readers had to say were:

  * It shows you are a real person with a job and other responsibilities who is trying to just do it all or as much as you can.
  * I always feel that you are REAL and that like us you try your best to make it all work (family, work, free time, and exercise).
  * I read because it’s motivational to hear about an “authentic” person who has to deal with fitness in the real world!
  * I like to support friends who blog.
  * I like GFG for the challenges: they’re challenging (go figure), elegantly simple, and impactful.
  * It’s so easy to get discouraged or distracted in our journey to a more healthful life. That makes it even more comforting and reassuring to read that someone who’s had as much success as Go Fit Girl might also get distracted or discouraged — but always finds a way to bounce back!
  * It’s relatable and everyone can take away a tip or two to incorporate into his/her life.
  * The thing I like most about Go Fit Girl, though, and what ultimately keeps me coming back to read, is the well-rounded, balanced approach that seems to me to be the most important part of a healthy lifestyle.

These are just some of the things my readers had to say. I would repost everything because they are all so awesome. And I am really flattered by the things people had to say about me and the blog. But if you want to read all of the amazing comments, [go here](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9943#comments). Feel free to comment as well.
