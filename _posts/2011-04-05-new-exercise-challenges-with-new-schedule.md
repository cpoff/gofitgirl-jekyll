My company moved to South San Francisco. Previously my company was in Emeryville, as is my gym. I was able to take extended lunch breaks and work out during the day. I could leave work 20 minutes before a class started in the evenings.  
I now drive to Emeryville, park and jump on a shuttle bus to South San Francisco. I am slowly trying to figure out my timing and what classes I can still take at the gym, yoga classes at the studio and times I can workout at the swanky gym at work.  
Today I took the 4:15 shuttle back and was back in Emeryville about 5 p.m. The Tuesday night spin class starts at 6. So I got to the gym early and did about 15 minutes of weights before I just hung out and checked Facebook on my phone until spin class started.
