During the workweek I eat my breakfast at work. There is no way I am getting up any earlier than I absolutely have to just to eat breakfast.  
This morning my friend and co-worker Amy shared her blueberries with me. So my Fiber One is joined by some yummy blueberries and a banana (we get fruit at work once a week and I snagged a banana the other day&#8211;the fruit around here goes pretty fast).

It is true &#8230; breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
