    These are all the items I reviewed from four different Birchbox mailings. 
  </p>
</div>

  
[Birchbox](http://www.birchbox.com) helps you find products that you&#8217;ll love, which is what the website says.  
I started my Birchbox subscription about four months ago. Once a month for $10 I get a fun pink box in the mail filled with mostly beauty samples. Some of the items I save for myself. Some I throw into the goodie bag for Comment Contest Tuesday prizes.  
Certain items are automatically punted to the Comment Contest Tuesday goodie bag because of a perfumey smell attached to the product or if a color really is just not me.  
For each sample I tried I will give a brief description then let you know if I would not buy this; I might buy this; I would buy this; I would definitely buy this. (The order of the items have nothing to do with best to worst or vice versa. They are in order of me trying them.)  
**Whish Hair Inhibiting Deodorant Swipe:** [The wipe](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/whish-hair-inhibiting-deodorant-swipes) had a slight perfumey smell, which seemed to go away after a few hours. It stayed sticky under my armpits for about an hour and then seemed to go away. Great to keep in your purse or in your gym bag. I might buy this.  
**Jouer Moisturizing Lip Gloss in Riviera:** This is a light and fun [lip gloss](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/jouer-moisturizing-lip-gloss-203) and it isn&#8217;t sticky. The sample is super small and fits great in my purse. I have been using it much more often lately. I would definitely buy this.  
**stilla stay all day liquid lipstick in beso:** Wow, well if you want to wear bright red lipstick and not have to reapply, which you can&#8217;t feel on your lips once it dries, then this is for you. This [liquid stick](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/stila-stay-all-day-lipstick) essentially stains your lips (temporarily, of course). I had this on while trying the Green Apple Peel (see below). As I was removing the peel I rubbed the wet washcloth on my lips. Most of the color stayed on my lips. I drank my water while wearing this lipstick and nothing came off. I would buy this product, but in a different color. (I tried the liquid lipstick and then applied the Joeur lip gloss for a little shine. I liked the combo. I also wore the lipstick to bed and there was still some on in the morning. And nothing on my pillow. It was like I was one of those women in the movies who wake up with make up on looking radiant. OK, it wasn&#8217;t quite like that.)  
**Serge Normant Meta Luxe Hair Spray:** [The spray](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/serge-normant-meta-luxe-hair-spray) had a light smell when first applied but that eventually goes away. It helped control my frizz. It holds strong. The sample size is quite generous. I would buy this (if it weren&#8217;t so expensive).  
**Juice Beauty Green Apple Peel Sensitive:** [The sample](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/juice-beauty-green-apple-peel-sensitive-strength) provided has enough for me to try this product several times. I used a generous amount as instructed. There was a light burning sensation at first. I have never had a professional peel&#8211;but I understand they have a burning sensation. The peel came off easily with a warm washcloth. My skin looked and felt clean. I would buy this.  
**Color Club Wanderlust in Pardon My French:** The [nail polish](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/color-club-wanderlust-collection) I received is a fun purple color. My initial try at this was a thumbnail that dried in about 7 minutes. First coat dried quickly. Second coat took a little longer. I eventually painted all my finger nails. I rarely paint my own nails (I get mani/pedis regularly). And I rarely paint my finger nails as I am hard on my hands and the color is chipping the next day. The color did OK for two days &#8230; until I cooked, did a little cleaning and washed my hair. Then the chipping started. I like wearing color in my hands, but it just ends up looking like crap. I would give Wanderlust a chance. I gave the nail polish a second chance and Day 2 one tiny chip on one nail, Day 3 a second tiny chip on a second nail. After a week it was chipping pretty good. I have gotten a ton of compliments on my color as well. To be fair I recently had gel removed from my nails, which dries out the nails and left them a little rough and damaged. But &#8230; I would buy this.  
**Borracha Wine Wipes:** As the packet says, it will wipe that wine off your smile. [The wipes](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/borracha-wine-wipes) worked when I wiped my teeth after drinking red wine. The directions tell you to wipe your teeth and mouth and tell you not to swallow the wipe. I wasn&#8217;t sure if that meant the actual wipe or the taste in your mouth, which is orange blossom and funky tasting. I only wiped my teeth because I didn&#8217;t want that taste on my tongue. I rinsed and spit. Even with the funny taste, I would definitely buy it. And I did. These come in a cute compact with a mirror.  
**derma e Hyaluronic Hydrating Mist:** [This mist](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/derma-e-hydrating-mist-with-hyaluronic-acid) is supposed to refresh, rehydrate and nourish dry, thirsty skin. I used it one morning on my face instead of my usual Clinique moisturizer. It felt cool and light as I sprayed. It had a light, pretty smell, which was OK for me. I realized this really isn&#8217;t a moisturizer. But I like using it during the day to give myself a boost of freshness. I have also gotten into the habit of setting my makeup with the mist. The sample is the same size you can purchase. I would buy this.  
**WEI Golden Root Purifying Mud Mask:** I have tried masks before. But never a [mud mask](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/wei-golden-root-mud-masks). It dried quickly and was easy to rinse off with a washcloth. My face felt clean, fresh and tighter after removing the mask. My face looked clean as well. The site stated: It purges all kinds of debris from your skin—from excess oil to environmental pollutants—leaving your pores nearly invisible. My pores definitely looked smaller after I used it. I would definitely buy this. And I did buy this. The individual packets say for one use, but frankly I am thinking three or four times this can be used. I have used one pod three times and there is still a small amount left for a fourth time (or at least partial fourth time). So I just keep in a baggie to keep it &#8220;fresh.&#8221;  
**My Prime Multi-Purpose Mattifying Moisturizer:** I use Clinique moisturizer and am happy with it. But I welcome trying out samples. [This moisturizer](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/my-skincare-multi-purpose-mattifying-moisturizer) is light and feels good on my skin, like silk. If I was looking for a new moisturizer this would be a good candidate. Though the full price is rather spendy. So the little sample is a good deal. As the day went on I started to understand why this moisturizer is so expensive. It is light, my face felt moist without getting oily. I may be changing my mind on this moisturizer despite the expense. I would buy this.  
**Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Elixir:** I can&#8217;t say for sure if this product does what it says it does without using it for a period of time. I did use it for a week. But I can&#8217;t say that my hair looks younger in a week&#8217;s time. I am not a fan of the smell of it, but that did somewhat fade away. It smells like candy, which is fine initially. But eventually it went away.  According to the site, [the serum](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/nexxus-youth-renewal-rejuvenating-elixir.) is supposed to strengthen from the inside out, resulting in healthier, younger looking hair in just one week. I wouldn&#8217;t buy this.  
**Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream:** [This cream](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/dr-jart-ceramidin-cream) is made for sensitive skin, which I have, but also dry skin, which I don&#8217;t have. This moisturizer seemed OK even for someone with oily skin. My skin felt moist without going greasy. I like this moisturizer. But it isn&#8217;t better than what I normally use. And frankly, the best moisturizer is My Prime. In comparison to My Prime, I would not buy this. I might buy it if it were the only moisturizer sample I received.  
**Number 4 Super Comb Prep & Protect:** [This spray](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/number-4-super-comp-prep-protect) is applied into towel-dried hair. It has a light smell, but I wasn&#8217;t a fan of it. Luckily it faded away. Sprayed into my hair it made my hair easy to comb through without any tangles and snags. I did (and always) condition my hair the times I tried the spray. I might buy this.  
**pürminerals CC Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 40:** [This cream](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/pur-minerals-cc-cream) works like a moisturizer, sunscreen and foundation. It was easy to apply. The foundation I regularly use has an SPF, but just 15. The moisturizer I use unfortunately doesn&#8217;t have an SPF. I like this cream because sometimes I want sun protection without really wearing makeup. But this also gives the skin a finished look while protecting from the sun. The cream was slightly heavy. I might buy this.  
**Tili Bags:** The bags come in two sets. [First set here](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/tili-bags1-quart). [And second set here](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/tili-bags-2-quart). You can use these for lunch, stuff in your purse, for your liquids when traveling. Though I am not sure if you can actually use them for travel. Is it just a plastic bag for liquids or a clear plastic bag? The bags are quite spendy for being a plastic bag. I will gladly use my cute sample. I would not buy this.  
To start getting your own Birchbox you must request a subscription. Once your request is accepted, you will fill out your profile so that your box will be tailored to you. (Unfortunately there is no way to request no perfumes. But they can be limited.) And there are Birchboxes for men, too.  
If there is a sample you really like and want a full-sized version you can purchase it from the [Birchbox Shop](http://www.birchbox.com/shop/). They also have a loyalty program that rewards you every time you shop, refer friends and give feedback on monthly samples. Sometimes the box will also include a coupon or discount code.  
Don&#8217;t forget Go Fit Girl! referred you. If you want to start getting your own Birchbox let me know and I can send you a referral link.

    I look forward to getting a Birchbox in the mail every month. I have enjoyed trying out most of the samples I have received and have already added a few new items to my beauty regimen. Birchbox gets 4 1/2 dumbbells.
