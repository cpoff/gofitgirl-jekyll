I went to the noon spin class today. It was a small class. Only four of us total, including the teacher.  
But it was a good workout. And it was even tougher than normal since my gracilis muscles were super sore. I think it is my gracilis. Looks like it from [this muscle chart](http://www.gwc.maricopa.edu/class/bio201/muscle/leg1.htm) I found.  
I am still hobbling around. The longer I sit the harder it is to move around.
