    The 5-pound bag of Costco candy has been dubbed the candy baby as it sort of resembles a newborn baby. Well, at least the size of it does.

For many years I have had a candy bowl on my desk at work.  
There are times it is very tempting to me and I feel like I can&#8217;t stop eating from it. Most of the time I find if I don&#8217;t start I am OK. Other times it is not tempting to me at all whatsoever.  
Today I had one tiny Baby Ruth. I told myself I could have one. I ate the tiny candy with tiny bites to make it last longer. It seemed to satisfy my need for chocolate and I wasn&#8217;t tempted to eat more.  
One of my co-workers came over this afternoon to get some chocolate.  
I told her how I ate one with tiny bites. She told me she heard some super model talking about how she kept her weight down. Apparently one of her tricks was to use a tiny spoon to eat ice cream. My co-worker tried it and she said it worked.  
It likely gives her brain time to realize the sweet tooth has been satisfied. That likely worked when I took my tiny Baby Ruth bites.  
I mentioned one of the tips I learned in Weight Watchers was to use a salad plate for dinner instead of a regular plate so your plate looks fuller. Sometimes you just have to trick your mind. I don&#8217;t normally do the small plate. I do the regular plate and fill at least half of it with salad (in a bag).  
We giggled as we talked about the [Romy and Michelle candy diet](http://www.flickr.com/photos/20985903@N05/4202293749/). And had a good laugh over the Devil Wears Prada cheese quote: &#8230;Â I&#8217;m on this new diet. Well, I don&#8217;t eat anything and when I feel like I&#8217;m about to faint I eat a cube of cheese. I&#8217;m just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.  
Of course, these are jokes. And should not be used for diet tips at all. I don&#8217;t believe in dieting. I believe in making healthy lifestyle changes and choices. It can be as simple as adding a side salad to your dinner; drinking a glass of water before a meal; parking at the far end of the parking lot/garage and taking a few extra steps; or even eating half of what was served to you (at a restaurant or a friend&#8217;s dinner party).
