    Yup, I'm THAT lady, the bag lady. Purse, work bag and gym bag usually accompany me to work.

Yesterday right before yoga I noticed that my left wrist was hurting. I don&#8217;t remember doing anything in particular to it to make it ache. But I am a klutz and run into things and forget that I did.  
For example, I have a bruise on top of my right foot. I have no idea or recollection on how I received that bruise.  
I am also the bag lady when it comes to transporting to and from work. Since I don&#8217;t drive to work anymore I need EVERYTHING. So I usually have my purse, work bag (with laptop) and gym bag. On Wednesdays I don&#8217;t normally have the gym bag as I go to yoga in the neighborhood after work.  
Anyway, yesterday I only had the purse and the work bag. But I still coulda grabbed one of my bags weird or awkwardly and hurt my wrist.  
I was worried that the hurt wrist would make problems while practicing yoga, especially duringÂ [Downward Facing Dog](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/491). I only noticed it a few times during my practice. I made adjustments to take the pressure off my wrist and make the pose more comfortable when needed.

The point of this post is &#8230; there are exercises you can do to help with strained, overused, tired wrists. I already knew a few on my own. But I decided to do a little research, which entailed me going to [Google and typing in _wrist exercises_](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&sugexp=gsis%2Ci18n%3Dtrue&cp=7&gs_id=p&xhr=t&q=wrist+exercises&qe=d3Jpc3QgZQ&qesig=DUWNcqj4hw3mNrDZdC5fTw&pkc=AFgZ2tn3j5-NPysdDh0q0BqyxjOeftVUQjQF2j1aFtE67eB14LRG3x7HlUa6lyuy_8tG3PW47G6ytJsNBTcwrnx5AAt7Y2SxfQ&pf=p&sclient=psy&source=hp&pbx=1&oq=wrist+e&aq=0&aqi=g5&aql=&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&fp=398a36f7bbe31f9a&biw=1268&bih=626). And I, of course, got a ton of hits.  
I have [tendonitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendinitis) in my right wrist. So that is usually the one that used overused or ends up hurting.  
The photo to the right has some great wrist stretches. [This YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAMDTWtVWtI) has a good routine with dumb bells to strengthen wrists.  
Here&#8217;s a [link with a diagram](http://www.pamf.org/sports/king/wrist.html) on wrist strengthening exercises.  
Everything I have posted seems to be helpful. But there is a lot of stuff out there, which you can find on your own easily and quickly.
