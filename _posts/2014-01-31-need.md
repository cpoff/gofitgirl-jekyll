    This evening I needed a home yoga practice for low back pain. Now I am catching up on my shows while enjoying a beer and microwave popcorn.

What do I need?  
What do you need?  
I have been really trying to listen to myself lately.  
Work has been extremely demanding and busy and overwhelming and stressful as we continue to go through transition. More than usual I feel tired, exhausted and wiped out.  
I have really been trying to take the queues my body gives me whether physically, mentally, physiologically, emotionally.  
Last weekend we had anÂ [Intensive Weekend at teacher training](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/01/intensive/), which was absolutely amazing and I learned so much. But it also took a lot out of me.  
I had a lot of things I wanted to do on Sunday. They were to attend Vickie&#8217;s morning yoga class; attend an optional hour discussion on meditation before our required three hours of teacher training; the three hours of class; and Sunday night Restorative yoga class.  
I knew that was all too much for me and something had to give. I decided to skip Vickie&#8217;s class and did my own home practice. This also gave me my whole morning to lounge, enjoy my coffee and do a little homework.  
I knew my body needed and would benefit more from a Restorative class than an asana class.  
I took Monday off to take care of me: sleep in; get a massage; run a few errands; get a few things done around the house &#8230;  
Lately I have been taking each day one day at a time. What do I absolutely have to do and what do I need? Do I need to sleep in? Do I need to curl up on the couch and watch a movie? Do I need to get some homework done? Do I need to do a Restorative home practice instead of an asana practice? Do I need to skip a public class tonight? Do I need a glass of wine or beer even though it is Tuesday (and I try to only drink on the weekends)? Do I actually have to work late to get a project or assignment done? Do I need junk food? Do I need to do absolutely nothing? Do I need &#8230;  
One of my friends in teacher training and I were chatting the other day and reminding each other and ourselves to listen to our bodies. She said, just because I can do something doesn&#8217;t mean I have to do it.
