I noticed yesterday evening that my lower back was sore, a good sore. Like I worked out hard and now I am sore.  
This morning I noticed that my butt is sore.  
It all has to be from my yoga class yesterday morning. And I think the [Wheel or Upward Bow](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/473) was the culprit.  
So anyone who doesn&#8217;t think Yoga is &#8220;real&#8221; exercise, well, you are wrong! ðŸ™‚
