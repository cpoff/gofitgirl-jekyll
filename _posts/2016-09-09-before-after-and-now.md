    <strong>BEFORE:</strong> In June 2006 (bottom left) I was standing in front of the Pope Mobile at almost my highest weight. (I started Weight Watchers in October 2006.) <strong>AFTER:</strong> In July 2007 (bottom right) I had hit my goal weight and displaying the same outfit as June 2006. <strong>NOW:</strong> I was striking a yoga pose (Virabhdrasana II&#8211;Warrior 2) in July 2016 for my photo shoot for Yoga in the Park.

For about the past year to year and a half I have been the healthiest I have ever been. Not the smallest or thinnest, but the healthiest.  
I turn 42 in one month and I feel amazing. And I think I look pretty good, too. I know that&#8217;s not what it is all about. It&#8217;s about being and feeling healthy. But I&#8217;ll be honest, it feels good to look good.  
I work hard at being healthy. At times it is easy. And other times it&#8217;s so so difficult.  
But I haven&#8217;t always looked the way I look now.  
When I was younger I was considered skinny. (I seriously hate that word and all that it implies.)  
I could basically eat and drink anything I wanted and not gain weight.  
Then I turned 25. I had a sedentary job. I worked second shift and ate a lot of my meals at my desk, which weren&#8217;t actually healthy and usually came in some sort of wrapper (as in fast food).  
Over a seven year period I gained 30 pounds.  
I hated shopping for clothes. I lacked confidence. It was difficult to go on hikes with friends.  
One day a friend and co-worker asked me if I wanted to join Weight Watchers with her at work.  
Seven months later I had lost the 30 pounds.  
I didn&#8217;t take official before (losing weight) pictures. But I went through old pictures and found a few that would work. After I lost the weight I took photos in the same outfits as the before. Check out [the photos here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.120474364708022.32072.101838933238232&type=1&l=da0cfe068f).  
Besides losing the weight and gaining confidence I learned how to eat better and make better choices. I started to exercise regularly. I had to buy pretty much a whole new wardrobe.  
Since July 2009 I have pretty much kept the weight off. (It can fluctuate a little.)  
I still need to pay attention to what I eat and how much I exercise.  
Now that I am a cycling instructor and yoga teacher I keep the weight at a healthy level and I have become stronger, leaner, more toned with definition. I have more muscle mass and I am healthier and happier.  
Even though I burn a lot of calories on a regular basis I still have to be mindful of what I eat and drink.  
I love to eat (which was probably my initial problem when I started to gain weight). But I try to take everything in moderation with food, alcohol and activity.  
Here&#8217;s to turning 42 as the best me I can be.
