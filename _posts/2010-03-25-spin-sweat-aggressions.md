Even though I have been taking spin for almost two years it is still the hardest class ever. But man, what a workout it is. Afterward I always feel great and a lot of times exhausted.  
Today was a tough day at work. Nothing bad happened. Just busy and some crazy fires (but really, what is new?). I was pretty spent when I left the office and I was looking forward to taking my aggressions out on the spin bike.  
I get to class &#8230; and the guy that I have had fan issues with was there &#8230; in the the prime seat (as in the path of cool air from the fans).  
I tell myself not to get all bent out of shape over this. So I decide to approach him and say, I know you don&#8217;t like the fan on you so can I turn on the big fan and it won&#8217;t bother you?  
His response, I don&#8217;t like the fan on me. I said, I know, so can we compromise? Him: I don&#8217;t know how we can compromise.  
I said, fine I will just move the big fan closer to me (mind you, this thing is huge and I really don&#8217;t know how I am going to actually move it).  
He then tells me that not as many people as I think want fan on them. And I should just move the smaller fan. _Uh, most people I have talked to do want the fan and those who don&#8217;t just don&#8217;t sit near the fan. Seems simple enough._  
Then he makes some sort of comment about how he was there first.Â _HOH BOY! Seriously, dude? First off, how old are you?You are sitting in the prime seat to be hit by a fan. You don&#8217;t think others want fan on them? I mean, there is a freakin&#8217; tornado fan in the room._  
My response was, well, last time I was here first you moved the fan.  
The I left it at that and moved the smaller fan closer to me and another spinner.  
And I raced the hell out of that class.  
After class and chatted with a fellow spinner. I wanted to make sure I wasn&#8217;t being a B and being unreasonable. He didn&#8217;t think so. He told me he thought I handled the situation pretty well.  
I don&#8217;t want to battle it out every time this dude thinks he rules the spin room. I try to be considerate of others. But seriously, I can&#8217;t spin without air. I feel like I am gonna die.
