    Yoga has been a big part of my life and exercise routine for almost five years.

Last Wednesday I missed yoga as I had to stay at work late and then come home and do more work. I was bitter and pissy about it.  
I have a lot of high priority projects at work right now. Things are a little tense and stressful.  
I am trying to take my [yoga practice off the mat](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-4184/5-Life-Lessons-of-Yoga-Off-the-Mat.html) and practice patience at work. Sometimes I do well at it other times not so much.  
Tonight in yoga class Baxter had us to [set an intention](http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/926). This is one of my favorite things about practicing yoga.  
Sometimes I focus my intention on someone I care about who needs some positive energy sent their way. Other times I set an intention for myself or my practice.  
Lately my intentions have been focused on me. Tonight I set my intention for a calm practice, which can also be taken off the mat in my life right now.  
Two different yoga teachers in recent months have mentioned my calm practice to me. One teacher whose class is a lighter lunchtime flow class said to me one day as she was helping me adjust into the pose that it appeared that I was having a calm practice.  
Soon after that Ashley, who teaches Vinyasa flow, which is much more intense and sweaty, told me that even in an intense class my practice is normally calm.  
I find this interesting as I don&#8217;t consider myself a very calm person. I am semi-high maintenance, and semi-Type A personality and can get easily riled up.  
But I feel my many years of practicing yoga has brought me to this point.
