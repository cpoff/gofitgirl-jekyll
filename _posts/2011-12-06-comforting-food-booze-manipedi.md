Can't get much more comforting than this." width="300" height="224" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/comfort-food.jpg)Every day gets a little easier with my Joey gone.  
When I am sad or depressed or even stressed I turn to food and alcohol. It&#8217;s not the healthiest option. But there are much unhealthier choices.  
I took yesterday off from work. I just took it easy. I lounged around and watched movies. Eventually I went to the grocery and picked up some treats for myself.  
In the early afternoon I headed to [Galaxy Nails](http://www.yelp.com/biz/galaxy-nail-salon-oakland) for a mani/pedi. They give the best legs and arm/shoulder massages. I was in heaven. (I used to get mani/pedis pretty regularly. But in an attempt to save money I have been holding off.)  
After that I grabbed a slice of pizza and a side salad and walked back home. I came home and found a movie called In America on, which I had seen a preview and wanted to watch.  
Eventually I got going on the dishes and cleaning up the house a bit as I hadn&#8217;t gotten much done over the weekend.  
I had my cheesy bites and wine for dinner. The doughnuts I had for breakfast and later the rest for a snack.  
I skipped the gym and yoga on Sunday and Monday. But today I went back. Forty-five minutes of endurance on the espinner and some abs and I definitely felt better.  
In case you are interested you can read [Joey&#8217;s last blog post](http://joeythecat.posterous.com/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-treats), with some help from Curt, and [my tribute to Joey](http://joeythecat.posterous.com/joey-1994-2011).
