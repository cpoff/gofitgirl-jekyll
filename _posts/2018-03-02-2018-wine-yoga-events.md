Wine and yoga events at Hip Chicks are so much fun! If you came last year, you know how great they are, and you likely want to come again. And if you didn’t have a chance to come and want to, book the below dates now!  

You don’t have to be hip or a chick to come and have fun. Guaranteed!  

The dates are **<a href="https://squareup.com/store/hip-chicks-do-wine/item/yoga-wine-april" data-cke-saved-href="https://squareup.com/store/hip-chicks-do-wine/item/yoga-wine-april">Saturday, April 14</a>** and **<a href="https://squareup.com/store/hip-chicks-do-wine/item/yoga-wine-may" data-cke-saved-href="https://squareup.com/store/hip-chicks-do-wine/item/yoga-wine-may">Saturday, May 12</a>**. (Summer dates are Saturday, June 23; Saturday, July 21; and Saturday, August 18.)  

Registration is from 1:45-2 p.m.; yoga from 2-3 p.m.; and wine  and sangria tasting from 3-4 p.m.

This year Hip Chicks is also throwing in a sangria tasting in with our four wines.

Bring a yoga mat and wear comfortable clothing.  
All levels are supported and welcome.  

You will enjoy an hour of wine-themed yoga fun with me. After yoga, we will taste four wines and one sangria from Hip Chicks do Wine.  

Glasses, bottles, cheese plates and beer are available for purchase during our tastings as well.
