One of my regular readers, Jen, asked if I would be willing to share what I eat to be successful on Weight Watchers®.  
So I am going to share my &#8220;menus&#8221;/tracking/what I have eaten this week.  
For those of you not familiar with WW&#8211;just a few things I want to mention before I launch into my food intake.  
Right now I don&#8217;t attend meetings (I do highly recommend finding a meeting that works for you. The support and ideas are amazing.) I track my food daily [online](http://www.weightwatchers.com/index.aspx).  
When on WW you get daily points, weekly points (which can be distributed throughout the week or maybe for one big outing or &#8220;frivolous&#8221; meal or party) and you can also earn activity points&#8211;if you exercise you earn more points for the day (and week).  
To be successful in weight loss or maintaining your weight planning is very important. I will admit that lately my planning hasn&#8217;t been great. Lucky for me at work we have a salad bar with a good variety of items and usually a lot of protein.
