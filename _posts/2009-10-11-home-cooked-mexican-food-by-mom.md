Most of this weekend has been consumed by alcohol and good cooking by Mom.  
My mom and stepdad were in town for my birthday. They go home tomorrow. And my plan is to get back to my regular workout and eating schedule tomorrow.  
Friday (my birthday) I had a big breakfast; then Mom and Â I spent a girls&#8217; day together, which also included cocktails and appetizers; sushi dinner&#8211;which was pretty much the only healthy thing I had all day. Saturday my mom cooked a feast for me, Curt and some friends: chicken flautas, rice, beans, etc. It was good but greasy and so unhealthy. Today we had a light breakfast, then cheese, salami and crackers, wine, then a visit to McNally&#8217;s for drinks. And then tacos&#8211;cooked by Mom. Man, they were good. I have my fat pants on at the moment and am feeling a little gross. But it was worth it. ðŸ™‚  
Check back and see how my attempt at getting back on track goes &#8230;
