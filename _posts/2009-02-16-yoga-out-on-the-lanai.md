I am in Maui and trying to stay on track with the exercise. Not so much with the food. ðŸ™‚  
Last Wednesday I started back at the gym with a yoga class. I attended yoga on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Thursday I had sore triceps.  
My gym&#8211;formerly known as Mavericks&#8211;is under renovations. So for 15 days the women&#8217;s locker room is closed. Which is a huge pain. So I am changing at work before and/or after my classes.  
This morning before breakfast I did about 25 minutes of yoga out on the lanai. It was so beautiful and peaceful. It is definitely harder to do when totally on your own. I even did poses I am not a huge fan of. But I did my three faves: pigeon, dolphin and lying down twist (I can&#8217;t remember the actual name).
