    There are modifications that can be made to Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog) to make this pose accessible to all. This pose can also calm the brain and help relieve stress and mild depression, according to <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/poses/downward-facing-dog/">Yoga Journal</a>. (Since this picture was taken my Down Dog has changed so much. I need to get a current picture to show you, dear GFG! readers.)

Over this past weekend I attended two 5-hour yoga workshops.  
There were supposed to be three, but unfortunately the Friday Fibromyalgia yoga workshop was canceled.  
I attended the two workshops at [Piedmont Yoga Studio](http://www.piedmontyoga.com).  
Piedmont explains a little about the workshops: Adaptive yoga is the tailoring of the practice to people who are not &#8220;sick&#8221; but have physical limitations. This 2-day workshop explains the benefits of yoga in helping with issues such as pain, mobility and emotional states.  
Saturday was on yoga and Parkinson&#8217;s with one of my favorite yoga teachers and people, Vickie.  
Vickie has been teaching people with Parkinson&#8217;s for many years and has learned so much along that journey.  
During my yoga teacher training we were required to observe and assist 25 hours of classes with any of the teachers who were part of the program.  
I observed some of Vickie&#8217;s Parkinson&#8217;s classes. It was fascinating and I always felt happy while there. And I learned so much. There are so many ways to do Surya Namaskars (Sun Salutations).  
And the best thing I learned was that yoga is accessible to everyone, no matter your limitations.  
Something I really like that Vickie says is to teach to the possibility not the disability.  
A simple and great way to explain what Parkinson&#8217;s does to someone is that the brain fails to communicate with the body.  
In the workshop we learned some great tips on how to work with someone with Parkinson&#8217;s or any other mobility issues or even beginners.  
I am excited to show my 93-year-old grandpa at some point how he can easily get himself up off the floor. He always jokes that he can&#8217;t do yoga because he can get on the floor but he can&#8217;t get up. No more excuses, Grandpa!  
Sunday was on yoga and emotional challenges.  
We all need healing at some point in our lives.  
The energy for healing lies in ourselves. Your yoga teacher (or therapist) is just your guide. I think that is important for all of us to remember.  
Right now I am trying to absorb and learn as much as I can. I feel lucky to live in an area that provides so much learning. Since June (when I graduated from yoga teacher training) I have taken at least four workshops and attended a 20-hour Restorative Yoga teacher training.
