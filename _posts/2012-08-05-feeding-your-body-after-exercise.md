    In-Shape City, where I am a member, seems to have a variety of drinks to choose from. The only drink I have ever purchased is water, when I have forgotten my water bottle.

I really wanted to blog on Thursday night. Mainly because I had skipped blogging for days before. But I got home late and still had stuff to do around the house and work work to do as well. And by the time I was done I was exhausted.  
The past work week has been exhausting and busy. And I anticipate this coming week to be busy as well, especially since starting on Friday I will be on vacation for 10 days! I can&#8217;t wait!  
I found an [interesting article on Yahoo](http://shine.yahoo.com/healthy-living/diet-exercise-better-losing-weight-164900774.html) about the mistake many people make by thinking just because they work out they can eat or drink anything they want. It&#8217;s all in moderation.  
I posted the link on both my personal FB page and the GFG! FB page. My friend and neighbor Jessie commented that after she works out in the morning she is so hungry. I know that feeling of needing carbs or protein and sometimes just feeling wiped out.  
So I asked her what she eats afterward.  
She said she usually grabs a Naked protein smoothie.  
So, of course, this prompted some research and lucky for you, a post.  
I looked up a Naked Protein Juice Smoothie, Protein Zone. And yes, according to the site I am looking at there is a lot of protein. But there is also a lot of other stuff.  
The first issue is the nutritional information listed is for one serving and the bottle has two. Tricky, yes? That&#8217;s why you have to read labels. Many packaged items do that. That&#8217;s why reading labels is so important.  
If you drink the whole bottle (which I think most of us are gonna do, right?) you are going to consume 440 calories (likely more or just about what you burned. A spin class burns roughly 500 calories.); only 4 g of fat; 240 mg of sodium; 68 g of carbohydrates; and 32 g of protein.  
[Click here](http://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=671546&storeId=10052&langId=-1) for full nutritional information.  
After my hardcore class Friday morning (where I probably burned between 400 and 500 calories) I came home and made toast (2 pieces of Sara Lee Delightfuls) and spread 1 tablespoon of peanut butter and a banana on it. I consumed 290 calories; 9g fat; 296mg sodium; 49g carbs; and almost 10g protein. I got my breakfast in and felt full and satisfied.  
I know I push the protein because that keeps you feeling full and that is important. Later for a snack I had some raw almonds. And for lunch a protein-enriched salad with beans and bleu cheese.  
Before I went to the gym Saturday morning I had my banana and peanut butter toasted sandwich. I did 15 minutes on the stair climber, an hour spin class and a 30 minute abs class. When I came home I had my second breakfast: A light multi-grain English muffin, a poached egg and a piece of turkey bacon (and, of course coffee). The nutritional information for the food adds up like this: Calories: 227; Fat: 7.5g; Sodium 422mg; Carbs: 28 g; Fiber: 8g; Protein 17g.  
What I also find helps me stave off hunger, especially after a hard workout, are raw almonds. You have to be careful with almonds because they are high in fat. I parcel out 22 raw almonds for a snack, a quick pick me up or on the way home from the gym. The nutritional information is as follows: Calories: 80; Fat: 7g; Sodium: 0mg; Carbohydrates: 3g; Fiber: 1.5g; and Protein: 3g.  
The protein in that drink is pretty awesome. I think if it keeps you full until your next meal it&#8217;s a great idea. And I realize it is easy. My breakfast options take some planning and a little time. And I get that the protein drink is just easier.  
Just be aware of what you are consuming. And don&#8217;t think just because you did the elliptical for 45 minutes that you can have a burger for lunch and it evens out.  
And I&#8217;m not saying you shouldn&#8217;t have a burger from time to time. But it can&#8217;t be a regular item on the menu. I love my burgers, too, and beer and wine and &#8230; yes, it&#8217;s all about moderation and awareness and knowledge.
