Curt and I decided to order sushi from [Sushiya](http://www.sushiyaok.com/), our favorite sushi restaurant, for dinner last night. They just started a delivery service and we thought we should give it a whirl.

We got our sushi &#8230; and a beer. We are regulars and they treat us well. We didn&#8217;t even order the beer. Curt wanted to save the big ol beer and I was gonna have a Kirin (we have in cans [fancy!]) from the fridge. And then I decided that I didn&#8217;t need a beer and the sushi and water would be all I needed.  
I retain water like crazy when it comes to soy sauce. Even if I use the low sodium. And I hadn&#8217;t planned on having any alcohol with dinner.  
I was proud of myself for recognizing the fact that I didn&#8217;t need a beer and had water instead.
