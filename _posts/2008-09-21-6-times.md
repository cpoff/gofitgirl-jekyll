My goal every week is to workout six times a week. Usually it is more like four to five times.  
But this past week I worked out six times:  
Monday: yoga  
Tuesday: yoga  
Wednesday: yoga  
Thursday: kickboxing  
Friday: yoga  
Saturday: spin; abs/core  
My normal sked is 3 yoga classes a week and 3 cardio: kickboxing, spin and advanced body conditioning (Wednesday evenings).
