  For the month of May I worked out 21 times! For someone who doesn&#8217;t like exercise that is pretty damn good, eh? I still don&#8217;t enjoy exercise&#8211;but it is part of my routine and I just do it. I work out at the gym here in my work building. It is free and easily accessible&#8211;hard to make excuses. Plus once I start working out I am totally into it.

  I haven&#8217;t started running again since my knee incident. I kinda hate running. Maybe I will get back into it. I have been doing the elliptical at the gym, which is my favorite machine. And at home I do my toning DVD, <a href="http://www.beachbody.com/jump.jsp?itemType=GATEWAY&itemID=31">Great Body Guaranteed</a>. The name is funny, but the workout is amazing. It focuses on stretching, abs, arms, glutes and thighs. Ten minutes for each section and it is killer and a great workout.
