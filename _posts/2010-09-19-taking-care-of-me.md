I missed my yoga class on Friday night. So I decided to take a yoga class this morning at a yoga studio in my neighborhood.  
When I was looking at the schedule the other day deciding what class I wanted to take I noticed that a teacher who used to teach yoga at my gym had the 10:45 to 12:15 class. So I took Sean&#8217;s class.  
He met with each student briefly and recognized me right away. He told me that the class at the studio was more intense than at the gym. And his classes at the gym were pretty intense.  
That was a tough but great class. I have never sweated so much in a yoga class. It was an amazing practice and I plan to go again.  
After yoga I hurried home, changed and jumped in the car to head to my massage appointment.  
I am doing the best I can in life right now to take care of myself physically and mentally with healthy eating, making it to the gym frequently, practicing yoga, getting monthly massages and mani/pedis. I am also trying to limit my work days to no more than 9 hours&#8211;which is happening more often than not.
