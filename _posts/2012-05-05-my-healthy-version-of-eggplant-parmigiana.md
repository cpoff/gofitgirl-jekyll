I love Eggplant Parmigiana. It is so delicious but so unhealthy with it being fried and all.  
I also love eggplant. Lucky for me I like most vegetables (and fruit).  
At Monday&#8217;s Earth Day event at work there was a mini Farmer&#8217;s Market. I bought some eggplant, which I normally steam in my rice cooker/steamer and mix with brown rice, seasonings and [Kung Pao sauce](http://www.amazon.com/Panda-Express-Kung-Sauce-18-75/dp/B004WVTYYG).  
Since I bought two I thought with one I would try to make a healthy version of Eggplant Parmigiana.  
I sliced the eggplant and baked in the oven for 10 minutes on each side at 350. After that I lightly slathered spaghetti sauce on both sides of each sliced piece of eggplant. Right now all I have is goat cheese. So I sprinkled a little goat cheese on top of each slice.  
I had some last night on its own with some healthy and delicious sides. It was pretty good. Of course not as good as the real deal. But good enough.  
For a late lunch today I cooked up some penne with a little bit of spaghetti sauce. I put the remaining two eggplants on top of the pasta and had a delicious meal. And the [Super Tuscan](http://andrettiwinery.com/wines/montona-wines) wine from Andretti is delicious as well.  
I think it is now time for a nap.
