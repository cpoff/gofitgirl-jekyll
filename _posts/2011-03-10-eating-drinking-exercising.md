I have come to the realization lately that I need to change my eating habits. I haven&#8217;t been doing a great job. I am just sucking when it comes to willpower.  
I usually do OK in the exercise area. This week I have already worked out five times: yoga; spin; spin; yoga; spin. But it&#8217;s the caloric intake I need to get some control over.  
I have been eating a little better this week. And without even making a conscious goal I have not had any alcohol during the week this week. I am trying to keep alcohol consumption toÂ the weekends.  
I do need to lose a few pounds to get back to my goal weight, which has been something I have been needing to get back to for some time now.  
Next weekend Curt and I are going to Vegas and I do plan to eat and drink whatever I want. But once I return I need to get back on track and lose some weight.
