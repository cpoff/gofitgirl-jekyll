Friday evening yoga was a good work out. I didn&#8217;t realize how good until yesterday and today.  
At the end of spin yesterday we were stretching. We did the whole [arm/chest stretch with arms behind the back](http://www.shapefit.com/stretching-exercises-behind-back-chest-stretch.html). Wow, at that point I realized how sore my shoulders were. (I think it was all the [vinyasa flows](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/sequence_builder/?action=custom&yj=sequence_view&id=30648) we did in yoga Friday night.)  
After spin I took the abs/core class but didn&#8217;t take the body conditioning class. (I left the gym a little early to come home to watch the USA/Ghana football match.) It was probably best that I didn&#8217;t do any weights since my shoulders were sore. As yesterday went on my arms started to get sore.  
And today my arms and shoulders are super sore. It is amazing how sore muscles can take a toll on you and make you so tired, too.
