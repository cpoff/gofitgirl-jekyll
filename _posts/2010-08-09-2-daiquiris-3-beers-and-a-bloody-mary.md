And that was just today.  
I spent the past three days in Tucson. When I arrived Friday night there was an [eegee&#8217;s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eegee's) slushie drink waiting for me in the car. I can&#8217;t think of a better way to arrive in Tucson. Well, having my mom meet me at baggage claim was pretty awesome, too.  
When I got to my mom&#8217;s she asked if I was hungry. So she heated me up a few green corn [tamales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamale) in the microwave. Oh, so yummy and so bad for you and me.  
The following morning my aunt, uncle and cousins came over for breakfast. We had [chorizo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorizo), [menudo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menudo_(soup)) and [Mexican pastries](http://www.mitierracafe.com/menus_panaderia.html). All delicious and all NOT healthy. After that a visit to Grandma&#8217;s and a beer. Then back to Mom and Fred&#8217;s for some lounging and wine and cheese and bread. Then to my friend Shelly&#8217;s for a barbecue. Then to dinner with my mom, stepdad, brother, his girlfriend, along with a glass of wine and some pizza.  
Sunday morning eggs, bacon and toast for breakfast. Then I headed to my grandpa&#8217;s for a visit and a beer. After that another visit to my grandma&#8217;s, where I was also able to visit with another uncle, and have two more beers. Then back to my mom&#8217;s for lounging, Lifetime, guacamole, salsa and chips and, of course, some wine. I had dinner with my dad at [Bison Witches](http://www.bisonwitches.com/menu_tucson.php). I had the beef and brie sandwich and a Red Stripe beer.  
After dinner I had to get another strawberry eegee. When I got back to mom&#8217;s I added some vodka to the slushie to make it more of an adult beverage.  
Monday morning a little chorizo burrito and pastry. Then a nice lunch at the [Arizona Inn](http://www.arizonainn.com/). We started off with some nachos. I had a Southwestern corn bread grilled cheese and two daiquiris. When I got to the airport I had a beer at the bar. The bartender accidentally made a Bloody Mary instead of a Margarita. She asked me if I wanted it. Otherwise she was going to have to throw it away. Heck, no way!!!! Throwing away a perfectly good alcoholic beverage&#8211;sacrilege!  
Southwest now serves Corona. Yea! So my coupons got me a couple of free beers. Oh, yeeeaa!  
So to sum up the weekend: there was a lot of eating and a lot of drinking. Oh, and no exercise was practiced.
