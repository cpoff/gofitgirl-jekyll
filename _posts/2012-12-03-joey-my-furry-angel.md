    Joey was a cuddle bug and loved to be close to you, especially if you were sleeping. He fit into our relaxed and laid back lives of lounging perfectly.

Tomorrow will be one year since I lost my beautiful furry boy, Joey.  
I can&#8217;t believe it has been a year.  
He was in my life for 17 1/2 years. That&#8217;s a long time. And I still can&#8217;t believe he is gone.  
Joey brought so much joy to my life and his unconditional love and cuddling were just two wonderful things about him.  
I am still heart broken over his death. I am not sure if I will ever get over it.  
People have asked if we will get another cat or if we want one. For now the answer is no. I wanted to be furbaby free for a year. And a year has come.  
Here&#8217;s the thing, Joey had an amazing personality. He was a cuddle bug and a sweetheart. He was definitely cat and would get pissy at times. But his personality for the most part was almost like a dog.  
I don&#8217;t think I could find another cat that would compare. And I don&#8217;t think I want to. Another cat will never be my Joey and I don&#8217;t know if I could bear that.

    We were a little family for more than 10 years. I will always cherish that and the 17 1/2 years Joey was in my life.

Watching TV or movies while cuddled under a blanket is just not the same without Joey. And it never will be.

<div>
  Â I feel so grateful that I had him in my life for so long. I will always cherish that time.
</div>

And even though this year has been tough I remember the many wonderful years I had with him and how much fuller my life is because of Joey.  
He was also in Curt&#8217;s life for a long time. Joey was about 6 when Curt and I first started dating.  
My two boys had a love/hate relationship. But eventually it was mostly love.  
Joey, your mama will always love you.  
Thank you for being my sweet boy and my furry angel.
