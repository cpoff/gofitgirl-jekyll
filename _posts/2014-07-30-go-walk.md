    My Go Walk Skechers while in Amsterdam.
  </p>
</div>

  
For our recent trip to Amsterdam I wanted comfy walking shoes. I have tennis shoes but I wanted something else.  
I bought the [Skechers Go Walk shoes](http://www.skechers.com/style/13569/skechers-gowalk-baby/bkw#Color=BKW). I have a couple of other pairs of Skechers and like them.  
The first time I put them on I couldn&#8217;t believe how good they felt. They are lightweight, flexible and super comfortable.  
<span style="color: #474747;">The Skechers website says this about these shoes: They elevate the natural walking experience, allowing you to interact with and respond to practically any surface, while offering the additional benefit of real world protection.</span>  
My shoe box claims this about the shoes: circular sensors flex and twist so your foot can move more naturally; proprietary lightweight, injection-molded compound with memory retention; anti-microbial insole wicks away moisture; scent protection built-in to combat odor; and lightweight.  
We didn&#8217;t do a ton of walking. But my feet never felt tired or over walked. They were always comfortable and well supported.  
And believe me, with some of the shoes I wear my feet hurt, are uncomfortable, can cause blisters, can squish my toes, etc. But not the Go Walks.  
I like these shoes so much that I just might be ordering another pair so when the first ones run out I have back up.
