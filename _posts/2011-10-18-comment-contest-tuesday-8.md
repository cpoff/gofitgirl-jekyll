    Some of my favorite shoes include my awesome red pointy shoes that almost always get a compliment; my blue and purple heels; cute leopard print flats; comfy Dr. Martens, Skechers and old reliable and completely comfortable tennis shoes.

It has been awhile since we have had a Comment Contest Tuesday. So it&#8217;s time to get excited. Woot-woot!!!  
The theme this week is feet. Yesterday I told you about how I love fun and sassy shoes. I even posted a photo of many of my shoes.  
So tell me what are your favorite shoes, your least favorite shoes, the shoes you love wearing, hate wearing? Do you worry about what your shoes are doing to your feet? What are some of your reasons for purchasing your shoes? Any comments or explanations you want to add would be great.  
You can comment as much as you want. Each comment in its own post will get your name thrown into the random drawing twice.  
To participate in Comment Contest Tuesday you must submit your answers in the comments below. The comment has to be relevant to what I am asking.  
You have until Friday, October 21 at noon (my time) to comment away. You have to comment in the comments on Go Fit Girl! I won’t accept e-mails, comments on Facebook, Twitter, etc.  
Tell me all about your shoes &#8230; please.
