Tuesdays I usually take a yoga class at my gym. But today I had a meeting at 1:30. So I missed my 1-2 p.m. yoga class.  
My Friday evening yoga instructor teaches a noon body sculpting class on Tuesdays at noon. So I decided to try it today. It was a good workout. Suraya encourages a little less in the weights, as Jennifer, on Thursdays and Saturdays, encourages more weight.  
But I got my bicep curls, lunges, etc. in today. And now when I leave work at whatever time this evening I can just go home and knit, oh, and practice guitar. ðŸ™‚
