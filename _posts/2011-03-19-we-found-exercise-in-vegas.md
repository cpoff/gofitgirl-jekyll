Jen and I hit the hotel gym this morning. Access to the gym came with Curt&#8217;s and my room.  
Jen did the treadmill and I did some crazy elliptical type machine. We both had a good workout.  
Every machine had a TV attached and headphones provided. Pretty swanky.  
After our workout we showered and met up for a yummy lunch at a sandwich place.
