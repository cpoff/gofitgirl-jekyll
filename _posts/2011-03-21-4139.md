That is pretty good.  
Most vacations I pack my workout clothes and they never leave the suitcase.  
I seriously think having a workout partner, Jen, made all the difference. So, Jen, I think you must go on all vacations with me. ðŸ™‚  
Day 1 was crazy elliptical and abs. Day 2 was treadmill and free weights.  
I didn&#8217;t pack tennis shoes this time around. Usually I do and it is a waste of space as they don&#8217;t come out along with my workout clothes. I wore my [Skechers](http://www.skechers.com/style/21159/bikers-hot-ticket/bkcc) while working out. They were OK for my two workouts. I wouldn&#8217;t suggest it if someone were working out more than a few times.  
Coming home from my fun and high calorie intake weekend brings me back to more reasonable meals and things I drink. For dinner tonight I had brown rice and steamed Brussels sprouts with water.  
I plan to hit my regular spin class tomorrow night after work.[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4154" title="IMG_1197" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_11971-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_11971.jpg)
