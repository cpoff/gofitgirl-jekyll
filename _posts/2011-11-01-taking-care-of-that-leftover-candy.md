    Extra Halloween candy (and glow in the dark bracelets) ended up in my candy bowl at work.

The day after Halloween. And all that leftover candy.  
I took my leftover candy to work and filled my candy bowl and a co-worker&#8217;s candy bowl. And I am proud to say I didn&#8217;t eat one piece today.  
Except for the Snickers most of the candy I have left over I am not really interested in so that helps. I find it best to buy items I am not a fan of.  
[Hungry Girl has some suggestions on how to survive the Halloween candy](http://www.hungry-girl.com/biteout/show/2131) yesterday, today and however long it lasts. She breaks down the candy by calories and fat.  
Tootsie Rolls, Hershey Kisses and 3 Musketeers Minis are some of the lower calorie candies. Dum Dum lollipops are low calorie as well. I am sure there are many more types of candy I could list, but I am not going to do that.  
It&#8217;s probably best to not to sit on the couch with a bowl of Halloween candy on your lap. I know that is easy to do. If you still have some candy left over, pick one or two and eat them and don&#8217;t grab more. You will thank yourself for it later.  
[This article](http://journalstar.com/lifestyles/family/article_cb0d6d3e-e6d5-5fcf-9958-90af0cad1d7c.html) has some great, fun and a few weird suggestions for how to deal with that extra Halloween candy.
