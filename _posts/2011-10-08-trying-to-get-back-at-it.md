I hit the gym this morning for the first time in a week. Between cat-related stuff and work and traveling to LA for a conference and laziness (it&#8217;s always so hard for me to get motivated when I travel) I have been slacking.  
Normally on Saturdays I do two hours of spin, abs and body conditioning. I just did spin today and headed out. That class was tough.  
Curt and I are heading to Napa right now for my birthday weekend. Good food and lots of wine tasting. And beautiful weather.  
And Curt will be driving my &#8220;drunk ass around&#8221; as he likes to put it.  
BTW: I am blogging from my phone.
