I take an abs/core class on Saturdays at my gym. The teacher also teaches a spin class right before the abs/core class.  
Next Saturday is Spinning Nation, four 1-hour classes of spin to benefit the charities Prostate Cancer Foundation Athletes for a Cure; AIDS Research Alliance; Cancer Schmancer Movement.  
I have taken beginner&#8217;s spin and it was tough. Jennifer, my teacher, is encouraging me to take her spin class next week.  
She told me donations are great, too. And I think I may just do it.  
I have already made a [donation to her](http://www.active.com/donate/spinningnation/JMedeir1).
