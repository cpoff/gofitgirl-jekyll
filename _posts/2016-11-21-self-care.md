As we get ready to enter what I call the Crazy Time Season we have to remember to take care of ourselves.  
Self-care is so important but we tend to neglect taking care of No. 1.  
I truly believe you can&#8217;t take care of anyone else unless you take care of yourself.  
Self-care comes in many forms. For me it can be a yoga class (where I am a student), my monthly massage, an occasional mani/pedi, vegging on the couch binge watching my favorite shows, knitting, restorative yoga, enjoying good cup of coffee or tea while just sipping and enjoying &#8230;  
Maybe for you it&#8217;s any of the things I listed above or it could be a bubble bath, a hike, a bike ride &#8230; or something else.  
Stress is a big part of our everyday lives.  
When restorative yoga is practiced regularly and even as little as five minutes a day, it can help to heal the effects of chronic stress. Adrenal fatigue is a common and growing problem in modern life. Restorative yoga kicks in the parasympathetic nervous system, rest and digest.  
On Sunday, Dec. 4 from 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. I am teaching a restorative yoga workshop.  
In my two-hour workshop I will offer some tips and ideas on how to start or enhance a home restorative practice. We will practice lovely and yummy restorative yoga poses.  
Stress and anxiety can wreak havoc on digestion. Some of the restorative poses we will practice will help to aid in digestion. You will be supported with bolsters, blankets and blocks to relax into poses while soothing, quieting and calming the nervous system, the body and the mind.  
We will practice “not doing” and just being with a more still, quiet and passive practice. In this workshop we will prepare our bodies and minds with quiet and stillness, which will help us to balance our energy during this busy time.  
You sign up for the [workshop here](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/admhome?studioid=204091). The Early Bird discount for the workshop is $35 if purchased by Thanksgiving. After Thanksgiving the price goes up to $45.  
This can be a birthday, Christmas, Hanukkah or just because present for yourself or maybe you can hint to someone else to foot the bill.  
I would love for my students and new and longtime friends to attend this workshop with me. But whether or not you take the workshop with me, please remember to take care of yourself and take time for you.
