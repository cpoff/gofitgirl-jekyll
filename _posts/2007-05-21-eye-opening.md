Tomorrow the admins are taking out my friend Alicia (who is in Accounts Payable) out for lunch to wish her good luck. We all work very closely with her and are sad that she is leaving.  
Anyway, we are going to P.F. Chang&#8217;s. I decided to look at the [menu](http://www.pfchangs.com/cuisine/menu_main.jsp) today to get an idea of what I can order.  
Luckily they also include nutritional information, which was rather scary. Most things are so bad I can&#8217;t believe it. I will be ordering the steamed veggie plate with a little brown rice.
