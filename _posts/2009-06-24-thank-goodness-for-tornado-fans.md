It has been a bit warmer these days. Well, it is summer. So you know, hitting anything above 70 around here is hot!  
Well, afternoons or evenings at the gym, especially upstairs, is almost unbearable. Since they won&#8217;t let us open to door anymore during spin class they got us an extra fan!  
I got to class yesterday and got a bike in the front row. A classmate of mine informed me that he had already turned the tornado fan on. Thanks Bob!  
I have to say that class was much easier (though still tough) with the wind blowing on me the whole time.
