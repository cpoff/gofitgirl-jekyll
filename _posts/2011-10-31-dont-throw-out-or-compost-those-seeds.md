    Getting ready to roast some pumpkin seeds and enjoy with a pumpkin beer.

I carved my pumpkins yesterday. I also saved the pumpkin seeds so I could roast them.  
I essentially [followed this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/roasting-pumpkin-seeds/detail.aspx).  I used seasonings I have at home: salt, pepper, onion powder, Kickin Chicken and I sprayed the cookie sheets with Pam.  
The hardest part about preparing homemade pumpkin seeds is getting the pumpkin pulp off.  
According to [this web site](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3141/2) one cup of pumpkin seeds is 285 calories and 12 grams of fat. No fiber, but 12 grams of protein in a cup. But really, who is gonna have a whole cup of pumpkin seeds? That&#8217;s a lot of seeds.  
Making pumpkin seeds at home is fairly easy. I am not one to want to be in the kitchen or enjoy spending time in the kitchen. But I do like roasting my seeds at this time of the year. Probably because it is so easy. And they are yummy!  
Happy Halloween! (Time to get ready for our trick-or-treaters. Candy, glow in the dark bracelets and even more fun stuff for kids who can&#8217;t have candy.)
