There is a restaurant near work where you can get pretty good, tasty, organic and fairly healthy soups, salads and sandwiches.  
On Monday I decided to try the lentil soup. After that I was hooked. It was delicious, filling and pretty healthy. And I was asking myself why I hadn&#8217;t tried this soup before. Yesterday I got my &#8220;regular&#8221; lentil soup and the manager declared me a soup freak after getting lentil soup three days in a row.  
Today I had lunch with my mentor who has also become a friend. We ended up at [Soup Freaks](http://www.soupfreaks.com/). And Day 4 of lentil soup. I am still not sick of it.  
Today is also Day 4 of my continued healthy eating. Tonight for dinner I took two chicken breasts and dipped them in egg white/milk mixture. After that I rolled them in crushed corn flakes with a little salt, pepper and Kickin&#8217; Chicken. Then baked them in the oven for about 45 minutes at 375. We had the chicken breasts with green beans. The chicken was really yummy. (I buy frozen chicken breasts, which are individually sealed. Usually the night before I pull two chicken breasts out and put them in the fridge to thaw.)
