I attended the noon spin class at my gym today. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would be able to fit it in today since I am leaving work early today to head to Vegas with Curt for a long weekend for fun and relaxin&#8217; and some NCAA tourney watching.  
I have to say after the afternoon spin class I feel so good and great. The endorphins are really amazing. The second half of my work day is so much more productive.  
And things have been so crazy lately at work that the class and the fact that I am away from work for some time is a great stress releaver.
