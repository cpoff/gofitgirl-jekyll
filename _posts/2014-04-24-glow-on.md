<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I was on vacation last week.</span>  
You know how you go on vacation and you (usually) come back refreshed and ready to take on life (and work)?  
And your &#8220;vacation glow&#8221; lasts a day, half a day or five minutes?  
I am determined to keep my vacation glow going as long as I possibly can.  
I have decided that I am not going to let the fact that I couldn&#8217;t get into my email or calendar for the first couple of hours I was back in the office on Tuesday take my glow away.  
Or that I had a bunch of meetings that day. And lots of emails to catch up on. And that some of those emails were a little angry.  
Or that Thursday I was still getting through my emails. Or that I had a new team member start and there was lots of training to do. (But she is awesome, patient and a quick learner.)  
My glow was put to the test many times my first week back at work. But I just wasn&#8217;t gonna let it go. Last week was amazing, relaxing, magical, awesome, fun. I developed some great friendships and deepened others.  
I truly relaxed and enjoyed myself, others, my meals, my time and especially being off the grid.  
I&#8217;m gonna hold on to this feeling as long as I can. And when I lose it I will just try to remember and bring myself back to the glow.
