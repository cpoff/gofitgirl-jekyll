I was tired and didn&#8217;t want to go to spin today. But hey, it is Day 2 of living a healthier lifestyle.  
So I made sure I went. When Boku (teacher) arrived I asked him if he had good music tonight. He said he hoped so. And he did. He played some great music, including It&#8217;s Raining Men. I told him after class I wanted to jump off my bike and start dancing. (Sometimes Boku plays some weird music.)  
It was a tough class. Boku even said it was tough for him. But it was a good work out. And I am glad I went and worked hard.
