I attended a 6:15 a.m. cardio/body conditioning class this morning. Why? Partially because I am crazy but also because my work team attended an offsite at the Giants ballpark today.  
The class I took was intense and insane. I am pretty sure I am going to feel it tomorrow: arms, legs, butt, etc. We started off with a warm up on the treadmill. Then there was some running around the room. Then doing cardio and body conditioning at the same time. I couldn&#8217;t even do everything. I just physically couldn&#8217;t keep up.  
Oh man, that 45 minutes of intense work (started off with 15 minutes on the treadmill) was killer.  
But then I figured I would feel a little less guilty about all the food I stuffed in my face today, including the beers.  
I told the instructor after class that his class was great but I likely would never be back and to please not be offended. My work schedule just doesn&#8217;t allow for that class and me getting to work on time. Which is a bummer. I wouldn&#8217;t mind adding that class to my regular workout schedule.  
I wasn&#8217;t sure I could get up at 5:30 a.m. and do cardio at 6:15 in the morning. But apparently I can.  
I took BART into the city and had a 20-minute brisk walk to the ballpark. According to Google maps it is about a mile one way. So I walked an additional 2 miles plus my morning workout.

We had so much food in our luxury suite: fajitas; pizza; crab cakes; 7-layer dip; fruit; beer; wine; soda; water; hot dogs; potato salad; spring rolls, cookies, Rice Krispie Treats &#8230;  
I did a pretty good workout at the work gym last night as well: race day on the spin bike, which consists of mostly moderate to heavy resistance and speed. It&#8217;s a high calorie burning workout.  
I think I am still full from &#8220;lunch&#8221; today and it is almost 8 p.m. I don&#8217;t know if I need dinner tonight. And I am feeling lazy and don&#8217;t really want to make anything anyway. So it works out, right?
