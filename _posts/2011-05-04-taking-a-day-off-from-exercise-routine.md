I came home from work today with every intention to attend my 6 p.m. Hatha Yoga class.  
As soon as I stepped in the door I started not feeling it. I am a little tired and it is warm today. My evenings are normally so short because of my long commute and the fact that I get up so early and go to bed so early.  
Plus I have worked out the past eight days in a row. So I think it is OK to take a break.  
So I am lounging, watching Lifetime Movie Network and sipping some water. I feel a nap may be coming on as well.
