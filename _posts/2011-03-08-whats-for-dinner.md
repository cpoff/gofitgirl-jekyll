[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4051" title="dinner" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dinner-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dinner.jpg)I have to say the best 20 bucks I ever spent was on a rice cooker/vegetable steamer from Target.  
Tonight for dinner I pulled out an [Eating Right shrimp stir fry mix from Safeway](http://www.safeway.com/ifl/grocery/CategoryDisplay?catalogIdentifier=EREatingRight&identifier=ERMultiServeEntrees). Scroll to the bottom of the page for information on the particular stir fry I made for dinner tonight.  
I also made brown rice in the rice cooker while I jumped in the shower after coming home from my spin class.  
Curt and I are now enjoying a delicious, healthy and filling dinner, which was pretty easy to make and easy on the wallet, too.
