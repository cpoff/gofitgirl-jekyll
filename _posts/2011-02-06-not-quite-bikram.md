I fairly regularly take a Sunday morning yoga class at the studio near my house. It is an intense [Vinyasa Yoga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinyasa_yoga) class, which I just love (and hate).  
I didn&#8217;t realize that Sean actually cranks up the heat for class until today. After class I asked him what the temp is during class. He told me he likes it between 75 and 80. I asked him what the temp in [Bikram Yoga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikram_Yoga) is. He said, usually between 85 and 95. Ouch.  
I am not sure how many calories I burn during 90 minutes of Sean&#8217;s class. But I am sure it is significant. After class today I was very hungry.
