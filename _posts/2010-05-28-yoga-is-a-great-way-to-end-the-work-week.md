Too bad I didn&#8217;t end my work week that way.  
Usually before a three-day weekend the office clears out early. I had a lot to do today. But about 4 or so I started to wrap up what I absolutely had to get done. (I pretty much always have work to do. I could work all weekend and not be caught up.)  
But I was ready to go home. I didn&#8217;t want to stay at work another hour and then go on to yoga.  
I met Curt at home and then we headed to McNally&#8217;s for a beer. That was a nice way to end the work week.  
Day 5 of still some decent eating. For dinner tonight I baked a potato. Then I sauteed garlic in a little olive oil and then added sweet little tomatoes, mushroom and broccoli. I put the veggies on top of the potato with salt, pepper, Kickin&#8217; Chicken and Tapatio. Quite delicious.
