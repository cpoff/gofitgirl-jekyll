During this time I am taking off from working full time I want to get back to healthy: physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and in any other way I can.  
I have started eating better, drinking even more water than I was before and I am even cooking a bit. (I&#8217;ve also started back with my regular home yoga practice, regularly attending public yoga classes and getting some cardio in at my gym.)  
Let&#8217;s get back to that cooking thing I mentioned above &#8230;  
Even though I have two parents who are amazing cooks, I don&#8217;t like cooking. When I was a kid and my brother and I were old enough we were given the task to cook one night a week to help our mom, who was a single parent.  
I absolutely hated it. I begged my mom for any other chore. So I had to vacuum the house. And to the day I still don&#8217;t mind vacuuming.  
I have many goals in mind during my break. One of them is not to become a housewife&#8211;this is no offense to housewives, it is just not me.  
One of my goals (besides tackling that atrocious unorganized pantry, cleaning up my e-mail inbox, teaching yoga classes, etc.) is to do a little experimenting with cooking. And because I have more time the cooking isn&#8217;t as painful. I can take the time to look up recipes, shop and make a nutritious meal for myself and sometimes The Husband who has been appreciating some of what I am making, too.  
The Husband has enjoyed the few meals I have made and said one night, I think I like this unemployment thing. I told him to not get too crazy!  
I am trying to go healthy and/or low calorie with my meals. (Just because something is low [or lower] calorie doesn&#8217;t mean it is healthy. But sometimes you just want mac and cheese, which tastes good!)  
A good friend and GFG! reader suggested an idea for the blog: [a Recipes tab](http://gofitgirl.com/recipes/). So today I debut the [Recipes tab here](http://gofitgirl.com/recipes/) at GFG!  
This is an experiment and will likely get some tuneups along the way. I&#8217;m still figuring it out. So if you like something or have suggestions, please speak up.  
As I transitioned into my new life I knew that a partial detox was necessary to help me kickstart the healthy lifestyle again. So last week during the week and this week as well I have been having a homemade green smoothie as my breakfast.  (Weekends I tend to have a sturdier breakfast&#8211;eggs, bacon and toast or out for brunch.)  
The first recipe being debuted on the [Recipes tab](http://gofitgirl.com/recipes/) is a green kale smoothie. (How many times can I say [Recipes tab](http://gofitgirl.com/recipes/)? You have to take a drink of your green smoothie every time I do.) A friend recently mentioned her morning smoothie and everything she throws in the mix.  I don&#8217;t remember everything. But here&#8217;s what I came up with:  
**Homemade green kale smoothie**

  * 3/4 to 1 cup of coconut water
  * 1 apple (with skin)
  * 1 banana (can be frozen)
  * 1 cup of raw kale
  * Ice (optional)

Throw the above ingredients into your high-powered blender. (I have a Ninja.) And drink. Without the ice this recipe makes about 18 ounces. I had thrown some bananas in the freezer one day as they were just about to go bad. I realized they would be great in the smoothie. It&#8217;s easier if you peel them and cut them into smaller pieces before freezing. Yup, I learned the hard way on that one.  
Keep the skin on the apple, many more nutrients: one large apple with the peel supplies 116 calories, no fat and 5.4 grams of fiber &#8230; a large apple without the skin contains 104 calories and 2.8 grams of fiber, according to [Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/470237-does-the-apple-skin-have-the-most-nutrients/).  
Some of the recipes featured will be ones I have experimented with myself, others will be links to recipes I have tried, some will be a mixture of the two.  
If any of my readers want to share a recipe (preferably healthy and/or low calorie), please send my way. I will give you credit and try it as well.  
Happy cooking or should I say blending!
