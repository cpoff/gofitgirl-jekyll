Eh, not so much. So today in yoga we focused on balance. I kinda hate the balancing poses. I get frustrated and impatient with myself.  
We did [tree pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496). One of my least favorite poses. I can&#8217;t even get my leg that high like in the picture.  
Balance is really important in a lot of the poses. I am getting better. But it is difficult.  
I weighed in today for WW and somehow (I have no idea how!!!) I was down about 6 ounces. I didn&#8217;t eat that great over the break. And I didn&#8217;t exercise as much as I would have liked. So in celebration of my slight weight loss I got a grilled cheese and fries for lunch. Yea, I know, not a great idea. But whatever!
