So last year my dad went back to school &#8230; California Culinary Academy, that is.  
He started his own blog [¡Que Aprovecho!](http://que-aprovecho.blogspot.com/) after he started school. He has also done a [guest post](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3214) or [two](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3339) for Go Fit Girl! Michael was also Go Fit Girl&#8217;s first Go Fit Boy!  
Well, on Monday my dad (aka Michael) started writing for the San Francisco Chronicle&#8217;s [City Brights](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/mchihak/index). He has started the baking portion of his studies. And all I can say is I better be getting some of those awesome cheesy biscuits. Though they would interfere with my healthy eating.
