I get e-mails almost daily called Wellness Works. I started getting them while at The Republic and made sure to change my e-mail to continue getting them after I was no longer a Gannettoid. Wellness Works are tips about health, diet, exercise, etc. There are some really good ones that I would like to share.  
Please bear with me. (And read them, some interesting facts):

**  
Tips to Maintain Long-Term Weight Loss**  
A recent article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (July 2005) reports that once you&#8217;ve lost weight, keeping it off actually gets easier with time. The article identified 6 important behaviors: 1. Get active and stay active; 2. Eat a diet low in calories and fat; 3. Don&#8217;t skip breakfast; 4. Hit the scales at least once per week; 5. Maintain a steady eating pattern; and 6. Catch &#8216;slips&#8217; before they turn into bigger problems.

**Carbohydrates**  
Everybody knows someone who swears by a very low carbohydrate diet. However, carbohydrates are not the enemy. Most reputable nutrition experts still agree that a large part (45%-65%) of your calorie intake should come from carbohydrates, particularly vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Nutrition research tells us that a high carbohydrate diet is still the best way for most of us to achieve and maintain optimal health.

**Healthy humus recipe**  
Here&#8217;s a quick & healthy hummus (chickpeas) recipe. Blend or food process 1/4 cup reserved liquid from one 16 oz can of chickpeas (also called garbanzo beans), the chickpeas themselves, 2 Tbsp lemon juice, & 2 Tbsp minced garlic. Spread onto a whole-wheat pita and top with shredded carrots, sliced olives, grilled eggplant, and roasted red peppers for a delicious and healthy appetizer, snack, or light meal.

**Eating out**  
Studies reveal that Americans consume 1/3 of their daily calories away from home. When dining out, consider trying one of these healthy eating tips: order half portions, ask for a side of veggies with your order, split your dessert, choose water or unsweetened tea instead of soda, skip the chips & salsa or bread & butter before your meal, and try to eat slowly (you&#8217;re less likely to overeat).

**Lots of Diets**  
Did you know that 65 million Americans go on a weight loss diet each year? And that as many as 48 million Americans are on a diet on any given day? Try on this idea: Dieting is not the solution for being overweight or obese. At best, diets are only a very temporary fix. Adopting gradual, but sustainable improvements to your eating and exercise habits are what can last you a lifetime.

**Mock Sour Cream**  
Try this recipe as a sour cream substitute! Blend 1-cup low fat cottage cheese, 1/4 cup buttermilk and 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice in a blender until smooth. This makes 16 tablespoon-sized servings with only 14 calories and 0.3 grams of fat per serving! Use as a topping for baked potatoes, gazpacho and low fat tacos.
