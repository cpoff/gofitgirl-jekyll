In a quest to try new things for this month&#8217;s Monthly Challenge I grabbed an acorn squash at the grocery recently.  
I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do with it. So I went online to find some recipes. I would have made a soup. But I didn&#8217;t have the other right ingredients or enough squash.  
First I baked the acorn squash for about 30 minutes in the oven.  
[This site](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-eat-half-a-squash-for-d-128739) had many options to choose from with recipes. I went with a variation of No. 2.  
I had a little couscous. It wasn&#8217;t quite enough for a filling filling so I added a little brown rice.  
The couscous was a frozen variety from Trader Joe&#8217;s, which included some squash and seasonings. I added seasonings to the brown rice and mixed the two grains together.  
It was delicious, healthy, filling and different. I liked it.  
I used the other half one day for lunch and just had it as a side vegetable along with my zucchini &#8220;pasta&#8221; and brown rice.  
In my research I found [an article](http://www.myfooddiary.com/blog/10-healthy-grains-beyond-brown-rice), which talks about 10 other healthy grains beyond brown rice, such as barley, couscous and quinoa, just to name a few.
