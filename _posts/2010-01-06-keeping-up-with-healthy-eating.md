So far so good on Day 3 of eating healthier.  
For dinner tonight I marinated chicken breasts in fat-free Italian dressing. Grilled them on the George Foreman grill. Curt and I both had salad. And for myself I made cauliflower &#8220;mashed potatoes.&#8221;  
Breakfast: oatmeal and coffee. Lunch: Zesty-Tomato Thyme soup and salad. Snack: some goldfish crackers. Oh and a glass of wine with dinner.  
When I went to the grocery over the weekend I tried to plan out possible dinners for at least four nights this week. Last night was Brussles sprouts over brown rice and salad. Monday night was shrimp and veggie stir fry over brown rice.  
What did you have for dinner?
