  Friends,
</p>

Thank you so much for your interest in my newsletter.  
Many have been asking when the next newsletter is coming out. The wait is over and here it is.  
This is my third newsletter. I have reposted the first two on my blog, <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362069-gofitgirl.com/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Go Fit Girl!</a> You can read the <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362073-gofitgirl.com/2016/04/my-newsletter/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">first here</a> and the <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362077-gofitgirl.com/2016/05/second-awesome-newsletter/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">second here</a>.  
Wow, first day of June. I have some exciting things coming up this month.  
Upcoming June yoga class themes:

  * Focusing on the **pelvis** from Wednesday, June 1-Monday, June 6. A neutral pelvis keeps the low back healthy. Many suffer from pelvic floor disorders, which can cause a lot of issues in the body.
  * **Low back** is the theme running from Wednesday, June 8-Monday, June 13. In the U.S. lower back pain is one of the most common complaints. The Mayo Clinic states that most people will experience low back pain at some point in their lives. Some causes of low back pain can be poor posture, tight hamstrings, herniated disc, tight hips, muscle strain, tight posas, etc.
  * Tuesday, June 21 is **Summer Solstice**. The week leading up to Summer Solstice (Wednesday, June 15-Monday, June 20) I will be teaching sun salutes (Surya Namaskar) to honor the arrival of summer.
  * I&#8217;m really excited about the sequence I&#8217;m teaching from Wednesday, June 22-Monday, June 27, which I am calling **a.m./p.m. yoga**. One of my students asked if I could teach some poses that could be done first thing in the morning and poses to do before going to bed. I will provide stick figures of the poses taught to my students.

<p id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1465173025999_82335">
  A lot of friends and students have been asking me about the heart opener over the blocks pose. I decided to write a post on it, <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362081-gofitgirl.com/2016/05/heart-opener-2/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">practicing heart opener</a>. My post talks about the benefits and teaches you how to get into the pose, be in the pose and come out of the pose whether with blocks or a roll.
</p>

I am excited to announce that <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362085-turtlesyoga.com/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Turtles Yoga & Wellness</a> (a studio where I teach) will be partnering with <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362089-athleta.gap.com/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Athleta</a> for <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362093-stores.athleta.net/store-4642/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Athleta&#8217;s June Studio of the Month</a>. All the classes are free. I am teaching from 8-9 a.m. on Saturday, June 11 at Athleta, Washington Square, in Portland. The other classes are Saturdays June 4, 18 and 25 from 9-10 a.m. See my <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362097-www.facebook.com/events/1535891640052776/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Facebook invite here</a>.  
After my June 11 Athleta class I am inviting students/friends to join me for a quick coffee at the Starbucks in the mall. I have another class that morning so I can&#8217;t hang out too long. Let&#8217;s have a quick coffee and a brief chat.  
Did you know that June 21 is <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362101-internationalyogadayportland.com/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">International Yoga Day Portland</a>? It&#8217;s also Summer Solstice, as I stated earlier. There are amazing things planned for celebration that day in Portland&#8217;s Pioneer Square, including free yoga classes, vendor booths and an Athleta fashion show at 11:45 a.m., where I will be one of the models. The other models and I have some fun things planned and we&#8217;ve been working hard to make sure the show is amazing. If you can take a break and come out, please do. If you have more time, come for a free yoga class, the fashion show, tour the vendor booths, rock out to the DJ, etc.  
At LA Fitness I use music by <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362105-www.powermusic.com/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Music</a>. They have lots of categories to use, whether for yoga or Pilates or cardio classes. For my yoga classes I stick with the yoga playlists. I played one recently that got a lot of comments and compliments, it was <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/gofitgirl/ann-s-highly-anticipated-third-newsletter/5362109-www.powermusic.com/music/music-genre/classical/power-down-9-classical-reflections.html?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Power Down 9&#8211;Classical Reflections</a>. I love Karma Moffett, and use his music at 24 Hour Fitness, The Xtreme Edge and Turtles Yoga & Wellness. Some of my favorites are Golden Bowls of Compassion, Ocean Bowls and Golden Bowls. (There is a lot of great calming music out there. And occasionally I will talk about it in my newsletter.)  
Stay tuned for more exciting updates coming soon.
