I was perusing the WW message boards and someone started this one.  
These are the responses so far. Some are pretty funny. (Minor editing involved.)  
You know you are a Weight Watcher when &#8230;

  * You literally lick the plate of every scrap because you counted those points and you&#8217;re eating every stinkin&#8217; one of them!
  * You drank enough water this summer to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool.
  * You start to feel like you are dealin summin &#8230; summin &#8230; getting out the cups and measuring everything!
  * Your kids ask how many points is that? Are you really going to eat it?
  * You attempt to type &#8220;PBS&#8221; and your fingers automatically type &#8220;PB2.&#8221;
  * It takes you 2 hours to grocery shop because you are using your points calculator on everything.
  * Your boyfriend (husband/significant other) knows the points system.
  * You can&#8217;t get any work done during the day because you&#8217;re addicted to the WW boards!!!!
  * You bring your sub home from Subway and measure to see if it&#8217;s a full 6 inches. If it&#8217;s not, you curse the sandwich artist in your head for ripping you off!
  * You check the Starbucks nutritional information before you tell your co-worker yes (or no) to a coffee break. (Gotta make sure you have enough points for whatever drink you want and if you don&#8217;t you find one worth fewer points.)

Here is the [link](http://www.weightwatchers.com/community/mbd/post.aspx?page_size=25&rownum=95&threadpage_no=4&sincedate=8%2f15%2f2007+12%3a00%3a00+AM&thread_id=106285980&board_id=1&forum_id=1&thread_name=You+know+you) if you are curious.  
And maybe more comments will appear.  
Also feel free to add your own You know you&#8217;re a Weight Watcher when &#8230; in the comments.
