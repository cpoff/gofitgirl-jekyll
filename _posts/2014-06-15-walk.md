Next Sunday I am getting up at an ungodly hour on my precious day off to head to San Francisco to walk with my friends/co-workers to raise money for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.  
We are walking in honor of a great man who left this world too early a year ago today.  
I was hoping to be No. 1 fundraiser on my team. So unless any of you want to donate 600 bucks I will have to settle for second place, which is pretty awesome, too.  
But I have one week to continue raising money for this important cause.  
If you would like to donate to me, please visit [my personal fundraising page](http://purplestride.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=1089448&lis=1&kntae1089448=716ABE45F384412CA013B22E0B184852&supId=403701865).  
And hey, besides raising money for something important I will also be walking about 3 miles (and hopefully on a gorgeous San Francisco day).
