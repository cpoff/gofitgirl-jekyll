So Saturdays are my normal day to work out for two hours: spin; abs/core; body conditioning.  
When I woke up yesterday morning I was so tired and dehydrated (did some drinking the night before) that I just couldn&#8217;t go to the gym. I was only planning on hitting spin because of a wedding Curt and I had to attend later in the day.  
Sundays are my normal off gym day. But I decided to go today since I missed yesterday. The elliptical on my own is not as good of a work out as spin class. But it was better than nothing.
