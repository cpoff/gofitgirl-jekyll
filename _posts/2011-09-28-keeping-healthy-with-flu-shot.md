[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6674" title="flu shot" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/flu-shot-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/flu-shot.jpg)Yesterday I got my flu shot. My company provides free flu shots every year. And I take advantage.  
A couple of years ago the nurse asked me if I worked out. I was flattered. As she was giving me my shot she said it would hurt a little more because of my muscle. Ugh. OK. (Side note: I absolutely hate needles.) At some point she told me that I should avoid exercise for a day or two and let the shot work.  
I had planned to do endurance on the spin bike yesterday afternoon. I had a lot to do at work and had to get home early for Joey&#8217;s vet appointment. So I ended up not visiting the gym, which was probably best. Plus my arm was pretty sore. It&#8217;s still a little sore today. But not too bad.  
I did go to yoga this evening. Wednesday nights are usually a little more moderate. We had a sub today and it was even more low key, which was perfect for me. I wanted a little challenge. But I was really looking for more for meditation and focus.
