    Kids, remember that stupid planking fad? Well, this is what real planking is all about. No excuses. I am planking at work while in a skirt and heels.

I stole that quote from my friend Nicole&#8217;s Facebook status. She was quoting her kid&#8217;s basketball coach. She said it was inspiring for her yoga practice.  
Lately I have tried to be more open minded with myself when it comes to exercise. There are yoga poses I know I can&#8217;t do&#8211;like handstand or headstand. (A bum shoulder keeps me from attempting the full pose.) But I can work toward them. There are other poses I don&#8217;t think I can do but instead of just saying to myself, no way, I now will at least try.  
Same thing with planks. We do them in yoga and body conditioning and abs classes. Whenever it is announced that we are going to do a 1-minute plank I complain and convince myself that I can&#8217;t do it.  
In my Friday morning body conditioning class (which is actually called Muscle Blast) the instructor recently had us hold a 1-minute plank. I, of course, announced to him that there was no way I could do that. He, of course, told me I could. We got into position and I asked him to tell us a story. Instead he talked to me the whole time and I did it. I held a 1-minute plank.  
Last month&#8217;s Go Fit Girl! Monthly Challenge was focused on push-ups. Push-ups are pretty difficult for me. I worked on push-ups but really focused on planks. I got up to an 80-second plank.  
As I have stated before my company has a Wellness Program. We have a variety of challenges, which change out every two months. I am participating in a team event to reach 5,000 &#8220;push-ups.&#8221; We have hit 5K and are close to 10K and have changed our personal team goal to 15K.  
I am also participating in another group challenge (no points involved, just pride) to work up to a 4-minute plank.  
And you can imagine I am doubting if that is even possible.  
We meet for about 5 minutes in the afternoons and just hunker down on the floor in an open area at the office and do our planks together. Sometimes I have a meeting or call and can&#8217;t join the group so I do my plank on my own in my cube area.  
The group started off with a 1-minute plank and we have worked our way up to 2 minutes.  
And this is coming from the girl who couldn&#8217;t (or wouldn&#8217;t) do a 1-minute plank.  
And maybe I can&#8217;t do a 4-minute plank. But I can at least work toward it. And I may surprise myself with what I CAN DO!
