    I gave my first speech at Toastmasters yesterday. Your first speech is called The Ice Breaker, which I titled It&#8217;s all about moderation.

[I recently wrote about Toastmasters](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10412) and how I had taken on my first major role in a meeting as the General Evaluator.  
Yesterday I took on another major role: The Ice Breaker.  
The Ice Breaker is the first prepared talk to &#8220;break the ice.&#8221; It&#8217;s supposed to be the easiest because it is about the person you know the best, yourself.  
Funny thing is everything I talked about I am comfortable telling anyone one on one or in a small group. But standing in front of a crowd of people who are all looking at you and listening to you &#8230; well, that&#8217;s another story.  
I hate the anxiety I feel right before and during public speaking. And I want to find ways to be more comfortable in those situations. That&#8217;s why I joined Toastmasters.  
Public speaking is considered the [greatest fear](http://www.glossophobia.com) a person can have, even greater than the fear of death.  
Challenging myself to get out of my comfort zone takes a lot of convincing. But I know it is important. Toastmasters is a great venue for this. The support is amazing. And I have to say I ended up with an awesome mentor. He is so enthusiastic and supportive and encourages me.  
I am also trying to learn to focus my anxiety and fear into a more positive experience.  
Fear and excitement have a nearly identical physiological response and chemical reaction in the body. [According to Ann McMaster](http://www.annmcmaster.com/ann_mcmaster_life_as_it_i/2012/10/letting-go-part-3-fear-and-excitement.html) fear and excitement are the same emotion.  
According to Catherine Hanrahan, who wrote Lost Girls and Love Hotels, “Fear and excitement are chemically the same. Sadness is a hair away from melancholy. Melancholy is almost pleasure, brushing against happiness. &#8230;”  
Yesterday I faced my fear and gave my Ice Breaker. I was as prepared as possible. I wore something that I felt good in and, frankly, looked good in, which helped boost my confidence. The dress I wore is my favorite color and coincidentally matched my toe nail polish. Not intentional. But the matching dress and toes received a lot of compliments.  
I was so nervous while up there. My legs were shaking and eventually I had cotton mouth. But I got through it and received two standing ovations. For your first speech you receive a standing ovation. The Toastmaster asked the audience to give me a second one as the event was a little bigger than normal and I was the only speaker (usually there are two).  
And the best part, well, besides facing my fear, Go Fit Girl! got a major plug during my speech. Afterward I got a ton of praise. Someone (who was visiting from another Toastmasters) told me they would have never known it was my first time speaking at Toastmasters. I had so many questions about GFG!, too.

  My next big role will be Toastmaster, which is essentially the emcee of the meeting.
