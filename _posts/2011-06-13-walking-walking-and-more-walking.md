Yesterday we did a lot of walking. Today we did a ton of walking. We visited Montserrat. It was beautiful and amazing.  
It is 7:30 p.m. We are home to clean up and rest a bit before we meet our friends Mark and Rosie at 9 and then head out to dinner.  
I don&#8217;t need to go to the gym while in Europe.  
Walking&#8211;and a lot of walking at that&#8211;is a amazing exercise.
