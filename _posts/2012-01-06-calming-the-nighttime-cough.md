    Slathering Vick's VapoRub, shot of NyQuil and a hit off my inhaler kept my cough calm last night.
  </p>
</div>

  
Last night I slathered myself with Vick&#8217;s VapoRub. I put it on my chest, my neck, right under my nose (so I would inhale it directly) and rubbed it on my feet, as suggested by Hilda.  
After she suggested that I decided to look that up as I had never heard of that before. I trust her because she is a yoga teacher. And anyone who knows anything about yoga knows about how important the feet are and the many [pressure points](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_D_9jF5PG994/S-RtGBOCX3I/AAAAAAAAA0U/vOT_9NftMrE/s1600/pressure+points.jpg) there are as well.  
I really couldn&#8217;t find anything that completely confirms or denies that [Vick&#8217;s on the feet is a way to counter a nighttime cough](http://www.snopes.com/medical/homecure/vaporub.asp).  
But I knew it couldn&#8217;t hurt.  
So last night soon before I went to bed I slathered on the VapoRub, took a shot of NyQuil and took a hit off my asthma inhaler, which helps calm my cough as I lay down and try to fall asleep.  
I still also have my pillows propped up so I am not lying flat while I sleep. (I like to sleep on my back, my stomach and my side. So the pillows prevent me from moving around a lot, too.)  
I don&#8217;t remember waking up coughing until about 4 a.m. That is what I call a successful night of sleep for the first time in about five nights.  
And I can&#8217;t confirm or deny that the Vick&#8217;s on the feet is what did it, since I tried a combo of things. I plan on the same thing for tonight.
