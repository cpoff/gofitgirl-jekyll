    Revealing my dirty little secret ... works on stank on clothes, too.

I have written in the past about how [I don&#8217;t wash my hair every day](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=6357). It&#8217;s not good for my hair or scalp. It has been more than two years since I have stopped washing my hair every single day.  
I wash my hair two to three times a week. It seems to be just right for my hair and scalp, which is what this [NPR article](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102062969) mentions.  
I have noticed that my hair doesn&#8217;t get quite as greasy as it used to.  
But when it does, or my hair needs a little freshening I use [TIGI&#8217;s Rockaholic Dirty Secret Shampoo](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&sugexp=gsis,i18n%3Dtrue&cp=11&gs_id=16&xhr=t&q=rockaholic+dry+shampoo&qe=cm9ja2Fob2xpYyA&qesig=Ju2WT7aeL56Yqw5562KRJg&pkc=AFgZ2tlR3O-9kjczXqku-u5J0Lap7fqYq5kTEIrnPf1qj0DAeLNbYVEEiizXrlx1k1p53JpGyJwHeoLURD_T3G8Vu79UmbRTRQ&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&biw=1268&bih=626&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=18404306398735640571&sa=X&ei=Ot5mTsy-MqXkiAKu-sSpCg&sqi=2&ved=0CGkQ8wIwAQ#ps-sellers). It absorbs grease and gives hair a clean smell.  
While in Vegas this weekend we hung out a lot at [Elllis Island Casino](http://www.ellisislandcasino.com/), which is a little more divey than casinos on The Strip. And the air quality is not quite as good either. The food is cheap as is the great tasting home-brewed beer &#8230; but the nasty cigarette smoke lingers. Bleh!  
I should have brought [Febreze](http://www.febreze.com/en_US/home.do) with us, but that thought never entered my mind until we reeked of cigarette smoke. I thought since the dry shampoo gets my hair smelling fresh, why not my clothes? I gave my jeans a good spray and the smoke smell was almost gone. I couldn&#8217;t believe it.  
Great, I won&#8217;t have to travel with my dry shampoo and Febreze in the future.
