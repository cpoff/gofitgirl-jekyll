The opposite of instability is &#8230; not certainty &#8230; it&#8217;s faith.  
Vickie was teaching that to us during our practice yesterday. I like it. And it makes sense.  
We all have had at some point in our life instability and lack of control.  
I bet most of my readers are experiencing some sort of instability right now.  
One of the amazing things about yoga (and there are a lot of amazing things about the practice) is that you can apply regular life stuff to your practice and vice versa.  
Yesterday morning we tried various poses while standing on [yoga blocks](http://www.yogaaccessories.com/Resources/ProductImages/YogaBlock3_ProdLarge.gif) (aka bricks).  
It gave an interesting perspective to the poses. I found them slightly easier. But I definitely felt like I had more control. Control within the stability &#8230; who would have thought?  
When our life is crazy and in chaos we just want something to control. So remember the things you can control and try to accept the things you can&#8217;t.  
I had an interesting conversation with a woman at the gym tonight before class started. We were talking about things that make people feel grounded. For some it is cooking, practicing yoga, knitting, exercising, gardening.  
What keeps you grounded?
