After work I headed to the gym for the evening yoga class. I really miss taking yoga more than once a week. But when classes get canceled and other times are tough to fit in your schedule it is what it is. So I take yoga when I can. And, of course, with this class being on Friday evenings I can&#8217;t always go. I mean, I do have a social schedule.  
Ken has taken over the Friday evening class. He is a really great and fun instructor. The class is now an hour and 15 mins. I have taken an hour and a half yoga class before and that just seems too long. But this timing seemed perfect. And we even went over the time a little. But we got a good suvasana in.  
After class I met my girlfriends for yummy sushi and some beer. Good food and good times.
