It is 8:45 and I am getting sleepy. Well, it is just about my bedtime. I try to get in to bed between 9 and 9:30. Though sometimes it is closer to 10. Once in bed I usually fall asleep pretty quickly. (I get up at 5 a.m. for work.)  
Last week [I talked about how I was going through a bad cycle of sleep](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=5708). Well, writing about that must have unjixed my sleeping curse. Because since that post I have slept pretty well.  
Maybe I am just on a good sleep cycle. Maybe my very regular exercise and conscious healthy eating (no alcohol during the week) are helping me sleep. Though I do tend to sleep well after even just one glass of wine. Maybe my post really did lift a bad sleep curse. ðŸ™‚  
Am I now cursing myself with bad sleep for the rest of the week? Nah, I don&#8217;t believe that stuff.

While waiting for Baxter&#8217;s 6 p.m. Hatha Yoga class at Namaste I snapped a shot of my toes and yoga mat&#8211;pictured to the left. In case you were wondering what that photo had to do with sleeping. Well, it has nothing to do with it. But since I don&#8217;t have a lot of photos of me sleeping &#8230;  
I do have tons of photos of Joey (my old man furbaby) sleeping. You can get a glimpse of him on the right. And he has [his own blog](http://joeythecat.posterous.com/) with many photos of him &#8230; sleeping.
