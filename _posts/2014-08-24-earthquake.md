    Some of the items in Curt&#8217;s and my emergency disaster kit.

Early this morning a [6.1 earthquake struck the Napa area](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Magnitude-6-0-earthquake-reported-in-Napa-County-5708791.php). Napa is about 40 miles from where I live.  
The 6.1 temblor did not wake me (or The Husband) up, which is surprising because of the size and that people living much more south of me felt it. And I usually wake up.  
We had no damage whatsoever at our place.  
We can&#8217;t predict when an earthquake is going to strike next. Being prepared is important.  
After Hurricane Katrina, Curt and I were living in the Bay Area and decided to put an emergency disaster kit together.  
We have bottled water, canned food, a chemical toilet, hand crank radio, glow sticks, etc. One of our newest items is the [Emergency Power Station](http://store.shopreadyamerica.com/70801a.html), which has four functions: flashlight, radio, siren and cell phone charger.  
Years ago Curt was out of town and in one night we had two earthquakes. The pictures above our bed are in &#8220;fake&#8221; frames. No glass. But the other walls in the room have glass frames. I grabbed my Uggs and kept them by the bed.  
Someone mentioned to me that they keep a plastic bag under their bed with a few items. So I now have a plastic bag under the bed with tennis shoes, flashlight, extra batteries and a glow stick.  
We also have glow sticks around different parts of the house in case we need to grab one immediately.  
In the car I have a kit with all the necessary supplies and a pair of tennis shoes. At work, I also have a pair of tennis shoes &#8230; just in case I have to walk home and am wearing stupid shoes to work (the stupid shoes part is about 100% likely).  
In November every year I go through our canned food in the emergency kit (and in our pantry). If it is close to expiration (within the next couple of months to a year later) I donate it to the food bank. If it is expired I toss it. And if it will be good until a little more than a year away it stays in the kit.  
If you live in an area where natural disasters do occur, it&#8217;s a good idea to have a kit put together. You can easily purchase one from the [Red Cross](http://www.redcrossstore.org/shopper/category.aspx?LocationId=1) or [Ready America](http://www.readyamerica.com) or you can even put one together yourself.  
The Red Cross has a [great checklist](http://www.redcross.org/prepare/location/home-family/get-kit) for you to follow. And even some much more extensive [information here](http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4240190_Be_Red_Cross_Ready.pdf).  
Be ready and be prepared because we never know.
