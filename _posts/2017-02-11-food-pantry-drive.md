I gathered with other women at a coffee shop in Beaverton to define our next steps, and envision how to transform the energy we saw at [Women’s Marches](https://www.womensmarch.com) into local and national action.  
Many things and ideas were discussed. It was a really beautiful and empowering experience. An amazing way to continue our work as peaceful and loving activists.  
I will write more about my experience at my first Huddle meeting later on. But for now I want to talk about something that came out of our meeting.  
We decided as a group something we can do easily is to help resupply the [Disability, Aging and Veteran Services](http://www.co.washington.or.us/HHS/DAVS/) pantry in Washington County, Oregon.

Items can be dropped off at [Solace & Fine Espresso](https://www.instagram.com/solace.fineespresso/) in Beaverton (4655 SW Griffith Drive) between 6:30-8:30 p.m. on Friday, February 17.  
I am really excited about this food pantry drive. When I was in the corporate world for seven years or so I ran the yearly food drive and toy drive. I loved doing. I felt good about myself, my company, our community, the organizations I worked with.  
I&#8217;m spreading the word about this food pantry drive here on Go Fit Girl!, in my social media world and with my yoga and cycling classes. (But I don&#8217;t want anyone to feel pressure or obligated. We all have organizations we like to support. And sometimes money/items isn&#8217;t something we can afford right now.)  
For the hygiene kits think about the next time you travel to grab all the soaps, shampoos, toothbrushes, etc. you get complimentary and donate those to shelters, various organizations. When I traveled more I collected those items and donated them to women&#8217;s shelters.  
If you don&#8217;t live in Beaverton or even Oregon you can contribute items or money to a food bank or another organized food pantry. Contact your local organization for their highest needs. (Maybe you can also spread the word to friends, colleagues, etc.)  
Or maybe there is some other cause you want to contribute to. That&#8217;s great. Do it! Raise money, donate money, time or services. Help better your community in the best way you can.  
If you do want to participate in the above mentioned food pantry drive but can&#8217;t drop your items off at the designated time and place I can make arrangements with you to get your items and drop them off. I will be dropping off items at about 7:30 on Friday evening.
