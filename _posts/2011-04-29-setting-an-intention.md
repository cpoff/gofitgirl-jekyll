Keeping with the yoga theme this week, I want to talk about just one of the many things that I love about yoga &#8230; setting an intention at the beginning of yoga practice.  
According to the Yoga Journal web site:Â [Setting intention](http://www.yogajournal.com/wisdom/926), at least according to Buddhist teachings, is a path or practice that is focused on how you are &#8220;being&#8221; in the present moment.  
Many yoga instructors will have you set an intention during mediation at the beginning of your yoga practice.  
Sometimes I set my intention toward someone else, sometimes to myself and sometimes to my actual practice. When I set my intention for someone else I feel that the energy of my practice sends healing energy to my family member, friend or myself.  
**Help me, please**  
Don&#8217;t forget that you can help me review some toner shoes by &#8220;donating&#8221; and voting for a shoe or shoes. [Please see the post from Sunday](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=4546).
