I had planned to do some yoga here at home this morning. But I decided to be lazy and enjoy my morning on the computer drinking coffee instead. ðŸ™‚  
I did go to the gym yesterday after work. I got to the gym about 1 p.m. and pounded away on the elliptical for an hour.  
So I feel today can be a freebie day. I mean, it is Christmas.  
Have a great day and holiday season everyone. Be safe!
