    Cooking multiple meals or parts of meals at once is a way to help myself out for the week. It&#8217;s easy to prepare my lunch or dinner by grabbing a tupperware or two out of the fridge, which was prepared ahead of time. (Lots of veggies going on in that picture. I love vegetables.)

I had promised you an exciting Comment Contest Tuesday. Well, this isn&#8217;t the one I promised. Sorry, that awesome one will be coming soon.  
But for now you get a different one. (Which I am a little excited about.)  
I have been pretty busy lately and I just feel like I can&#8217;t get everything done I want to at work and at home. My life feels a little crazed.  
So I want to know from my busy readers, how do you do it all? Whether you are a mom or a dad or some sort of caretaker or someone without kids or with grown kids or someone with a lot of responsibility in your life.  
How do you get it all done? Or maybe you don&#8217;t. What do you sacrifice? Sleep, exercise, eating healthy? Do you have work/life balance?  
For me, things around the house can suffer. Or maybe I am so exhausted when I get home that I just have cereal or popcorn for dinner or sometimes I skip dinner (gasp!) or just have a glass of wine (double gasp!!).  
I try to catch up on weekends. Or I am so tired from my busy week that I just veg all weekend and get nothing done.  
Sometimes I will get multiple outfits ready (picked out and ironed) for the workweek or I will cook a big batch of something for a few meals throughout the following week. This past Sunday I prepared a few posts for the blog as I knew this week would be busy.  
I&#8217;m hoping the comments in the post will inspire, help, give guidance and or/ideas to each other.  
Here&#8217;s the drill. For each separate comment you make you get your name thrown in a hat twice for a random drawing for a prize. You can comment as many times as you want. The more the happier I will be. And you want to make Go Fit Girl! happy, right?  
And this time you have a whole week to post, until next Tuesday (July 24) noon, my time to comment away.  
Comments will only be counted if they are made on this Comment Contest Tuesday post. No comments on Facebook, Twitter or via e-mail count.  
So start commenting ladies AND gentleman. I look forward to hearing from my readers.
