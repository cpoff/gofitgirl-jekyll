    Thanks to Monica P. for supplying me with these snazzy onion goggles.

Recently I posted a tip on Twitter that if you put an onion in the freezer for 10 minutes you won&#8217;t cry when you cut the onion. (My [Go Fit Girl! Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoFitGirl) tweets also post on [Go Fit Girl!&#8217;s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/GoFitGirl), which is where I get most of my comments.)  
My cousin mentioned that if you light a candle while cutting the onion that will also help. I did try that. It helped for the most part. But it only lasted so long and then my eyes started tearing up when I was just about done cutting.  
According to [Everyday Chemistry](http://www.humantouchofchemistry.com/why-onions-make-us-cry.htm), when a candle is lit near the chopping board the gas that is emitted from the onions gets drawn toward the flame of the burning candle or lamp and it does not reach your eyes.  
My friend Monica told me about these onion goggles she saw at a kitchen store. She told me that I should review them for the blog. I told her if she bought them for me I would try them out and write a review.  
Monica bought the fashionable red onion goggles for me. Yes, I felt silly and goofy while using them. But they do work. The foam seal on the glasses keeps the vapors out. I could still smell the onion. Normally for me I smell and right after that the sting hits my eyes.Â My eyes never teared while wearing the onion goggles.  
I wear contacts most of the time. But after showering in the evening I am sporting my glasses. And you can&#8217;t wear the goggles over the glasses. That&#8217;s probably the only negative for me. I am near-sighted. But it is not wise for me to cut an onion (or anything for that matter) without my contacts or glasses.  
The [RSVP onion goggles are about 20 bucks on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/RSVP-International-Onion-Goggles-Black/dp/B0014SQU1A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361241439&sr=8-1&keywords=onion+goggles). If that is too steep for you or you would just rather not buy onion goggles, I recommend the freezer trick.  
There are [many tips out there](http://www.wikihow.com/Chop-Onions-Without-Tears) and I haven&#8217;t tried them all. Some of them seem a little unsafe for me, like cutting your onion under running water or by steam. I don&#8217;t need any extra help in the danger department. Apparently contacts are supposed to help. For me, they don&#8217;t.  
I give the RSVP onion goggles 4 1/2 dumbbells.

    Besides being a little steep and the silliness factor the RSVP onion goggles do exactly as they promise and get 4 1/2 dumbbells.
