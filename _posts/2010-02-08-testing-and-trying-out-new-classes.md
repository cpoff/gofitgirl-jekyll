Since my a.m. Monday/Wednesday yoga class has been &#8220;temporarily&#8221; canceled (I am keeping my fingers crossed that that is just temporary) I am trying to figure out what to do on Mondays and Wednesdays.  
Last Wednesday I added another night of spin. Today I went to an evening yoga class called Yoga Fundamentals. It was a more basic yoga class. But it really put focus on each pose we did. For [Warrior II](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/495) we did it against the wall. We used a block to press our knee against the block to press against the wall. It really made me focus on keeping my knee in the correct position.  
I enjoyed the class and will likely go again. Since I have next Monday off from work I will try to hit a noon spin class, which is taught by Jennifer, my Saturday spin teacher.
