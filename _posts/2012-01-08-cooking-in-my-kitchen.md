I did a lot of cooking this weekend. Well, a lot for me anyway.  
[Lory Benson Pilates](http://www.lorybenson.com/Site/Welcome.html) posted a good and easy recipe on Facebook recently. I made the [Quick Carrot and Tomato Soup](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=209971019091684&set=a.101404139948373.2370.100002363610848&type=1&theater) yesterday.  
It was fairly easy to make and I liked it. For me personally I needed to add some spice to it. So next time I will likely add at least half a  jalapeno.  I think the next time I have it for a meal I am going to pour it over brown rice.  
Today I made Warm Lentil Salad with Roasted Root Veggies, a recipe I found in my Yoga Journal. It came out really yummy. I roasted my veggies a little too long, which means the veggies shrunk a little. But other than that it came out well and tastes delicious and is rather filling.  
*\*\\*\*Cold update\*\*** My cough is getting better and better every day. The past three nights I have slept through the night without waking up coughing. Good sign! Between the NyQuil, Vick&#8217;s VapoRub and my asthma inhaler I am surviving the nights and sleeping rather well.
