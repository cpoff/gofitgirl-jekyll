    Curt and I wore our Arizona shirts on Sunday hoping the good mojo would get my Cats in the tourney. It didn't work. üôÅ

Curt and I head to Vegas tomorrow night.¬†This will be our third annual Vegas trip for the opening of the NCAA Men&#8217;s basketball tournament, which starts Thursday morning.  
Our good friends Jen and Dave will meet us on Friday.  
Last year Jen and I discussed [doing our best to get some exercise in](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=4102). Jen did some research and a Google search on ‚Äúbest place to exercise in vegas.&#8221;  
The first hit she got was [How to Avoid Exercise in Vegas](http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2010/4/1/17447/52651/vegas-travel/How+To+Avoid+Exercise+in+Vegas).  
I Google searched the same term this year and my fourth hit was the link How to Avoid Exercise in Vegas.  
I have no problem avoiding exercise in Vegas with the drinking, basketball watching, pool lounging, eating, gambling and fun.¬†I am hoping our hotel room at MGM Grand comes with gym access, because that gym is super expensive.  
I had access last year and Jen and I put it to good use.¬†It&#8217;s funny, Jen and I would meet in the morning and exercise and the guys would meet and scope out a bar or a good place to place bets. The girls, of course, met up with The Husbands later on. We like our beer and basketball, too.  
I will invite my &#8220;sister-in-law&#8221; to join me again for some exercise. But Thursday morning I will be on my own.¬†I found last year that it was easy to exercise because I had a buddy.  
Normally when I take gym clothes with me on vacation they never leave the suitcase.¬†My exercise clothes are already out and ready to go into the suitcase.  
Wish me luck.  
Not sure how much updating I will be doing. I do hope to get some calorie burning in. But I definitely will be eating, drinking, doing a little gambling (penny slots) and watching some college basketball, even if my team didn&#8217;t make it to the tourney. Boo!
