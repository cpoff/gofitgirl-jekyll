Last year (yes, it has been many, many months) I asked my readers what they wanted to know or any questions they had for me. I am slowly researching and getting through the questions. And if you asked me a question, I haven&#8217;t forgotten and I will get to it.  
Penny wanted to know &#8220;if those funky tennis shoes&#8211;the ones that are kind of curved on the bottom, so that your heel goes really far down as you walk&#8211;really work or not?&#8221;  
I am willing to try out a pair of &#8220;toner&#8221; shoes to see if they really work or not. But they are spendy and not something I would normally want to buy on my own.  
So, my dear readers, I have done a little research and have come up with four possible shoes to try out. But I need some help to buy the shoes.  
Here is what I propose: Read the minor descriptions of the shoes I have picked out. For every dollar you donate to me you get a vote on a shoe. For example, you donate 5 bucks you get five votes and you can use those votes all on one shoe or more than one shoe. Before I can purchase the shoes I need at least half the cost of the shoe. So read, review, donate and vote.  
(Under the ABOUT ME on the right you will see Shoe Review &#8220;Donation voting.&#8221; Click on the drop down menu and select an amount to &#8220;donate.&#8221; Then add to cart. When you are reviewing your information before payment you will see Note to Seller: Edit. Click on edit and vote for the shoe(s) there.)  
**The shoes you can vote on and I can wear and review:**
