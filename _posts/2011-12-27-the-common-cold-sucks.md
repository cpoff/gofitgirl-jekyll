This week off from work (my staycation) the plans were to relax, get some stuff done around the house, have a few meals with friends.  
There has already been a lot of relaxing. What I didn&#8217;t plan for was to get a cold. The cold has thrown some of my plans for a loop.  
I am bummed that I got sick over my week off. But then it is kinda a blessing as I hope to be well and rested by the time I have to go back to work on Monday.  
Every day this week I had plans for some sort of exercise. So far I missed spin yesterday and yoga today.  
The last time I was sickÂ [I wrote about whether it was best to exercise or not when sick](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=4431). I don&#8217;t exercise when I am sick. I feel that my body needs time to recover and heel and my energy should be spent on getting healthy.  
This appears to be a mild cold so I am really hoping I can go to yoga tomorrow night. Curt and I are taking a day trip tomorrow. So we&#8217;ll see how I feel when we get back. Sitting or sleeping in the car should be restful. I don&#8217;t plan to use a ton of energy riding in the car or while eating those delicious oysters.
