 **Guest Post: Alicia, a third-timer!**

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  I’m a great baker, but the problem is there are only so many cookies, cakes, pies, etc. anyone can eat before their pants start to explode. All this means is that a girl has to learn to how to cook “normal” food, too.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  Cooking means saving money and calories from buying take out, but unfortunately my cooking skills are limited.  So I rely on cookbooks and the Internet for recipes and ideas for my meals.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  A few things I have found about recipes are that they require too much oil, butter or cheese and the serving sizes are too large.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  For example I found this yummy sounding  recipe for Capellini Pomodoro&#8211;Angel Hair Pasta Recipe from <span style="line-height: 15px;"><a href="http://southernfood.about.com/">Southern Food</a>.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  Capellini Pomodoro&#8211;Angel Hair Pasta Recipe
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  Ingredients:
</p>

<ul style="text-align: left; ">
  <li>
    3 cloves garlic, minced
  </li>
  <li>
    2 cans (14.5 ounces each) good quality diced tomatoes, or about 2 pounds fresh peeled and diced tomatoes
  </li>
  <li>
    1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  </li>
  <li>
    2 cups fresh chopped basil leaves
  </li>
  <li>
    1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
  </li>
  <li>
    1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  </li>
  <li>
    12 ounces dry angel hair pasta, cooked
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  Preparation:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  Heat olive oil and add garlic; cook until garlic is tender. Add tomatoes and pepper and heat through, stirring constantly, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer hot, cooked pasta to large bowl. Toss pasta gently with tomato mixture, the fresh chopped basil, and half of the Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately and pass remaining Parmesan.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  Serves 4.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  The first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  It was delicious, but it felt a little greasy and  I felt that it was more than enough food for 4 servings.  The second time I made it I reduced the oil to 1 tablespoon, reduced the cheese to ¼ cup, and was able to get 5 to 6 servings out of the recipe.   It was perfect!  With just a few modifications anyone can make a yummy, healthy and economical meal.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; ">
  Enjoy!
