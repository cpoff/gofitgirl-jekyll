Curt and I are getting ready to head to Mexico City tomorrow. We haven&#8217;t had a real vacation in some time. So I am looking forward to this for a variety of reasons.  
Sometime back I e-mailed my doctor asking if there were any recommended vaccines or medications I should take before heading down south.  
She recommended Hepatitis A to help with anything I might eat or drink; a new tetanus shot with pertussis to prevent whopping cough and bug spray with Deet.  
When I was at the doctor&#8217;s office the medical assistant giving me my shots also mentioned typhoid medication would be a good idea. So she got the doctor to write a prescription.  
I want to make sure I stay healthy and happy and enjoy my time in Mexico City&#8211;where my great-grandmother grew up. (She actually grew up in a village outside of Mexico City called Alamos, which is actually part of the city now.)  
Until now I had no idea what typhoid was. And it is nasty with the ewwww factor.  
According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_A), Hep A is usually spread by the fecal-oral route; transmitted person-to-person by ingestion of contaminated food or water or through direct contact with an infectious person. Ugh! Eww. Glad I got the vaccine.  
According to [National Digestive Diseases Information Clearing House](http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/hepa_ez/#1), What is hepatitis A?, Hepatitis A is a liver disease. Hepatitis <span style="font-size: 11px;"> </span>means inflammation of the liver. Inflammation is the painful, red swelling that results when tissues of the body become injured or infected. Inflammation can cause organs to not work properly.  
According to the [Department of Health, New York](http://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/pertussis/fact_sheet.htm), pertussis (also called whopping cough) is a highly contagious bacterial infection that causes an uncontrollable, violent cough lasting several weeks or even months.  
I had my last tetanus shot in 2005. So I was almost due for another anyway. And now I will be protected from a horrible cough, which I have heard can be quite painful.  
The US Environmental Protection Agency says [DEET in bug spray](http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/chemicals/deet.htm) is used to repel biting pests such as mosquitoes and ticks, including ticks that may carry Lyme disease. DEET&#8217;s most significant benefit is its ability to repel potentially disease-carrying insects and ticks.  
According to the [CDC website](http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/typhoid_fever/), typhoid fever is a life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium _Salmonella_ Typhi. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 21.5 million persons each year. You can get typhoid fever if you eat food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding _Salmonella_ Typhi or if sewage contaminated with _Salmonella_ Typhi bacteria gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food. Therefore, typhoid fever is more common in areas of the world where handwashing is less frequent and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage.  
OK, ewww, so glad I took my typhoid vaccine. I almost didn&#8217;t get the prescription filled. And then Curt went to the doctor to get his Hep A vaccine and also got a typhoid fever prescription.
