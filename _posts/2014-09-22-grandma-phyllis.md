    Grandma Phyllis and Grandma Lisa (my grandma) so happy at Curt&#8217;s and my wedding, which was almost 11 years ago.

Curt&#8217;s grandma, Grandma Phyllis, died Friday morning.  
Grandma Phyllis was 87 and a feisty woman.  
I first met Curt&#8217;s whole family at a family reunion in May 2000. Everyone was kind and accepting of me and I felt very welcomed.  
Soon after that I started e-mailing with Curt&#8217;s grandma. She always signed her e-mails Grandma Phyllis. So before we were married or even engaged I called her that.  
She made me feel like one of her grandchildren immediately. And there was no doubt that she loved me.  
I was lucky enough to get to spend some quality time alone with her on occasion, like the time she came to visit Curt in Portland. Or when she and I had a girls&#8217; sleepover at her house.  
She had a great laugh. And if something was funny enough you could bring her to tears. Like the time she and Curt&#8217;s parents were visiting us in Oakland for Christmas and I opened a gag gift from my grandma or the time Curt and I were moving from Oregon to Phoenix and we stayed with her in San Diego for a few days and Joey wasn&#8217;t allowed in a particular room so his little paw was darting under the door.  
Playing Taboo with Grandma Phyllis was always hilarious with the same question: I can&#8217;t use any of these words?  
She loved her family unconditionally.  
For years for her birthday we always sent Thin Mints for a treat, which she gobbled up delightfully.  
Kate, her little shi-poo, made her so happy and was a great little companion for her.  
Grandma Phyllis, you will be missed terribly. But I am grateful I had you in my life for as long as I did.
