As for most or all people, sleep is important. It definitely is for me. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t sleep well. A good night of sleep for me is only waking up two or three times during the night.  
Right now for some reason I am in my bad cycle of sleep. This means I wake up 10ish times a night and sometimes when I wake up I can&#8217;t fall back asleep immediately. I usually end up in the spare room at some point and sack out on the futon.  
I almost never have a hard time falling asleep. I do that great. It&#8217;s the waking up all hours of the night that is tough on me.  
Now that I get up at 5 a.m. for work, sleep seems even more important. I am not super happy if I don&#8217;t get enough. I try to go to bed between 9 and 10 p.m. But really I prefer between 9 and 9:30.  
I remember hearing that sleep-deprived people tend to eat more. This article, [Why a Lack of Sleep Can Make You Fat and How to Keep From Gaining Weight](http://www.health.com/health/condition-article/0,,20232959,00.html), from Health.com talks about how lack of sleep can alter your appetite.  
Here&#8217;s an article from WedMD, [Sleep and Weight Gain: Will Better Sleep Help you Avoid Extra Pounds](http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/lack-of-sleep-weight-gain), that basically says the same thing.  
I found both articles informative. And they both gives tips on what you can do to fight sleep-deprived weight gain. Planning is a big key player&#8211;at least for me. I try to not have too much coffee or sweets or any kind of extra pick me up during the day. I have my regular supply and routine during the workweek.  
I do have a cup of coffee when I arrive at work, and I usually only have one cup, with a little creamer and Splenda. While making my coffee I also fill up my 16 oz. glass of water. I either have oatmeal, steel cut oats or cereal for breakfast. The oatmeal and oats I usually add a little fruit, usually blueberries.  
For morning snack I have some carrots and a Babybel Light. For lunch I normally have a Lean Cuisine frozen dinner and bagged salad with Salad Spritzer. My afternoon snack can be a piece of fruit; more carrots and Babybel Light; almonds; Greek yogurt; things like that.  
Many of my dinners consist of brown rice and some sort of steamed vegetable; or it can be a chicken breast marinated in light Italian dressing with a side salad or vegetable; sometimes vegetable/shrimp stir fry with brown rice.  
I try to find filling foods that also taste good and are easy to make. Of course, I stray and will have a huge thing of pasta or a honker burger and a beer or two or three or too much delicious cheese or one too many glasses of wine.  
I find that planning is key. That is really what will help you get through the day. I bring most of my own food to work. Some healthy snacks are provided at work. And there are also healthy meal options. But to save money and control calories I bring my own lunch.  
I have to say even when I am tired I push myself to exercise. Afterward I am always glad I did. Oh, and I drink lots of water. (I am almost off soda.)
