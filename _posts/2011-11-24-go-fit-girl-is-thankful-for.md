&nbsp;  
the fact that I am fairly healthy.  
the fact that I can afford a gym membership &#8230;  
and a yoga studio membership.  
the fact that I can afford fairly healthy food at the grocery.  
the fact that my company has a gym on site.  
my spin teachers, especially Jenn.  
Baxter&#8217;s fun and goofy nature during Wednesday night Hatha class &#8230;  
especially last night&#8217;s Thanksgiving-themed class.  
all of my yoga teachers: Ashley, Lily, Rachel, Vickie, Sean, Baxter (mentioned above) and the occasional sub.  
a boss who works out as much as I do (and possibly more).  
my clip shoes for spin class and the espinner. (Fewer foot cramps and feet that fall asleep.)  
Restorative yoga, Hatha yoga, Vinyasa yoga and yoga in general.  
the fact that work encourages a wellness plan.  
all the friends I have made at the gym &#8230;  
and the spin social &#8220;hour&#8221; we have before Saturday class begins.  
my yoga studio hosting a Day of Thanks 2-hour workshop &#8230;  
and Naushon is teaching it &#8230;  
and all the proceeds go to the food bank.  
my IT support husband who helps me with the the site.  
all of my Go Fit Girl! readers. Your support is so appreciated all these years &#8230; or if you just started reading.  
Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Be safe and healthy.
