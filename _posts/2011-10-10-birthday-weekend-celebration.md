I spent my birthday weekend in Napa. There was lots of good food eaten and wine drank and beer and mimosas.  
After spin class on Saturday Curt and I headed up to the Napa Valley. We had lunch at our favorite Italian restaurant. There were wine tastings at [Mumm](http://mummnapa.com/) and [Andretti](http://www.andrettiwinery.com/), where I am a member. So all the tastings I want.  
There was dinner (yea for mac and cheese!) and beers and brunch and mimosas. And more beer at McNally&#8217;s and sushi and beer to end the weekend.  
I took today off for a mental health day. I spent the morning lounging and then headed to the noon spin class, which used to be a regular class for me before my company moved.  
I almost skipped spin today to keep the lazy on. But I knew I would regret not going.  
Four other regulars, plus, of course, Jenn, were there and all of those I consider good Â friends. We were all chatty and having a good time right before and as class started.  
I just felt happy and in a great mood. Not something I normally feel when at spin or really exercising in general. It was a nice feeling.  
OK, spin is always tough and at the end of each class I always wonder how I get through class. But I do. But today was especially hard. It was so humid outside. For some reason it rained today. It&#8217;s only October. It&#8217;s not rainy season yet. We had the fans going and the door open and it was so hard and humid and bleh.  
I took today off as an extended birthday weekend (for my birthday and just a break from work and all the craziness going on right now). So I treated myself to a massage. Wow, Thanh is a miracle worker. I felt like a noodle afterward. I just came home and vegged on the couch with the furbaby.
