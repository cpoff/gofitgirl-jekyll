Today is Day 7 of my week. Mondays start over for tracking food and a weigh-in. If I weigh-in on Mondays, which I won&#8217;t tomorrow. (Since I won&#8217;t be at work.)  
Sundays are normally my day off from working out. I thought about working out today. But then I decided to sleep in and be lazy.  
I missed Friday at the gym. But five work outs in one week ain&#8217;t too shabby.  
Since tomorrow is a holiday there are no classes at the gym, which is a bummer. The noon spin class would have been perfect. I plan to visit the gym tomorrow&#8211;possibly creating my own spin class. Or maybe I will work out on the elliptical. Who knows. We&#8217;ll see.
