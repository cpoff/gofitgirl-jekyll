Are you eating healthy? Are you on Plan (aka Weight Watchers Plan)?  
For anyone who has tried to lose weight or tried to maintain a healthy lifestyle that can be a question you hear from your friends especially as you are trying to decide where to eat lunch.  
I had a lunch date today. I have one on Thursday. And Curt and I are planning on having dinner on Thursday night.  
So today when Melissa and I were trying to decide where to have lunch my only request was no Mexican and something with a healthy option. (I love Mexican food, but there are really no healthy options.)  
Before we went to Vegas a couple of weeks ago my goal was to get back to my goal weight before hitting The Strip and that pool. I didn&#8217;t quite make it. And I ate and drank whatever I wanted while in Las Vegas. There was a birthday dinner last week and then guests in town.  
So yesterday I decided it was time to get back to the healthy eating again. And I can&#8217;t use eating out as a reason or excuse to not make healthy choices.  
I am all for splurging on a meal once or twice a week. But the healthy snacks and meals need to be much more frequent from now on.
