**Guest Post: Erica**  
As you know, [from a previous post](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=2915), I loved to spin but chose to stop fairly far along in my pregnancy. I had to keep my <span id="lw_1250569043_5" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">heart rate</span> below 140 and that pretty much meant sitting on my butt and slowly peddling along. It wasn&#8217;t fun so I decided to put spin on hold until Baby O arrived.  
Between then and now I walked a bit, did <span id="lw_1250569043_6" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; cursor: pointer; background-image: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: transparent; border-bottom-style: none; border-bottom-width: initial; border-bottom-color: initial; background-position: initial initial;">prenatal yoga</span> and whatever I could when I mustered up the energy (<span id="lw_1250569043_7" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">third trimester</span> lethargy ya&#8217; know).  
Baby O (aka Finn) arrived July 7 and since then I have been dying to get out of the house and do something physical. It is &#8220;fry an egg on the sidewalk&#8221; hot here (we live in Phoenix) so we can&#8217;t walk outside unless we go around 5:30 a.m. So Finn and I have taken to mall walking. At first I was skeptical, but I have been converted.  
It is not as nice as walking outside or having a destination, but it is nice to be able to get some exercise (albeit not too strenuous when walking behind lollygaggers) without overheating. I was surprised to see so many mall walkers in the middle of the day on a Sunday. They were raring to go with their walking shoes, capri work out pants and iPods. I also saw a lot of moms with strollers &#8230; with one kid, multiple kids and with friends who also had strollers &#8230; almost a gaggle of soccer moms also trying to find a way to beat the heat. I guess this is a local phenomenon and I am just late catching on!  
Fortunately it was a bit cooler a few days last week. So Finn and I were able to walk outside early in the morning, but considering summer won&#8217;t be over for a month or so, I imagine we will continue to walk Paradise Valley Mall and <span id="lw_1250569043_8" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Scottsdale Fashion Square</span>.  
And, when desperate times call for desperate measures, Target, Costco, whatever we can find! Happy trails!
