Today I participated in my fifth spin class for the week. Let&#8217;s just say this class was the most difficult of the week. My thighs were on fire within the first 5 minutes of class.  
After spin the regular abs and then body conditioning. In body conditioning we did squats and lunges on the ball. I absolutely hate squats and lunges. But that is the work I really need. Even though I thought I was gonna die from the burning thighs I liked doing the squats and lunges better that way. It wasn&#8217;t easy&#8211;just different and I guess more doable.  
Earlier I was sitting on the floor at the coffee table and I could really feel my thighs. I wonder how they will feel tomorrow?
