I have been taking yoga consistently for two years. I truly believe that one never masters every yoga pose.  
I continually learn new things about each pose and new things about my own body.  
I am amazed that after two years I am still adjusting and improving my [downward dog](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/491) and making it better. It seems like such a simple and easy pose. But it is really very complex.  
The more I practice yoga the more intrigued I am by it. Besides that it is an amazing workout that works on flexibility, balance, patience, stretching, etc. each pose has a purpose to your body externally but also internally.  
This [simple seated twist](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/487) does all of this:
