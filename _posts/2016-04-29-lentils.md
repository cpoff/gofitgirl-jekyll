    Delicious lentils can be made with meat (I used chicken) or vegan.

One of my yoga students recently shared a lentils recipe with me, which he had made and thought I would like it as well.  
Let me just say, wow, delicious.  
He found it online and it is basically [this recipe here](http://peasandcrayons.com/2012/08/madras-lentils.html).  
It doesn&#8217;t take much work to prepare the ingredients for this recipe.  
Here&#8217;s what I did:

  * 2 cups of lentils
  * 2 cups of tomato puree
  * 2 cups of chicken stock
  * 1 potato diced
  * 1 onion peeled and chopped
  * 1/2 cup coconut milk, unsweetened
  * 3 tbsp. butter
  * 3 gloves of garlic
  * 1/2 tsp dried oregano
  * 1/2 tsp cumin
  * 1/2 tsp kosher salt
  * red pepper flakes to taste

Throw all ingredients into slow cooker. Cook on high for 4 hours. Once cooked I added three chicken breasts, which were already cooked.  
I added red pepper flakes in my bowl instead of the full recipe. I love super spicy. But not everyone else does.  
I added chicken to this recipe. But it could be made vegan without the chicken and you could substitute chicken stock for vegetable stock or even water.  
The recipe is delicious, filling and healthy. It is great as leftovers.  
As leftovers I would scoop some into a bowl and add a little more chicken stock and then nuke.  
You could also serve the lentils over rice.  
You could double the recipe to make a really huge batch.
