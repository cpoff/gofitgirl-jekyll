Yoga has given me the opportunity to meet so many great people and make some amazing friends.  
I regularly take classes at two yoga studios in Oakland/Berkeley.  
One of the studios, [Namaste](http://ilovenamaste.com), which has a total of three studios in Oakland and Berkeley, celebrated its 10th anniversary. And Namaste threw a big party today.  
There was music played by <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.adrienneshamszad.com">Adrienne Shamszad</a>; dancing by <a href="http://www.bhaktinova.com">Nubia Teixeira</a>; and the night ended with <a href="http://jaiuttal.com/news/">Jai Uttal</a> and band playing some amazing <a href="http://jaiuttal.com/what-is-kirtan/">Kirtan</a>. </span>  
<span style="color: #000000;">One of the great things about being a part of yoga studios and classes is that you become part of a community. </span>  
Even though I didn&#8217;t know a lot of people there I saw so many friendly faces. And I did get to spend the evening with one of my favorite people who is a great friend and an amazing yoga teacher along with another super fun yoga teacher and friend.  
We had so much fun dancing and singing. It was great to see so many sharing such a fun time. It truly was a community dancing, singing and celebrating.
