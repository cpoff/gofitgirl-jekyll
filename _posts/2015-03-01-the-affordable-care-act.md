    My healthcare is pretty basic, with a few extras thrown in, such as osteoarthritis of the jaw and exercise-induced asthma.

I have always believed that everyone should have access to affordable healthcare. I praise countries that provide healthcare to all of their citizens and visitors.  
Healthcare should not be a privilege to those who can afford it. I believe it is a human right and should be accessible to everyone.  
With that being said, today Curt and I become recipients of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.  
This doesn&#8217;t mean we are getting free healthcare. We still have to pay. But it is much more reasonable than paying out of pocket without the ACA option.  
It was easy to sign up. And we had many options for our medical and dental.  
I have been a tax paying citizen since I was 15. My first &#8220;real&#8221; job (besides babysitting) was scooping ice cream at Baskin Robbins for 2 bucks an hour. Yup, you still pay taxes even when you make that little.  
I don&#8217;t really want to get into the whole argument about whether or not the ACA should exist. I believe it should. AND there are many things my tax money goes toward that I don&#8217;t agree with. But that is part of being a citizen of the United States.  
And the ACA isn&#8217;t perfect. But as time goes on adjustments will be made to make it better.  
I am at ease knowing Curt and I are both covered. Thanks a lot, Obama!
