[Turtles Yoga & Wellness](http://turtlesyoga.com) (a studio where I teach) and [Athleta](http://athleta.gap.com) Washington Square are partnering as June Studio of the Month.  
On Saturday, June 11 from 8-9 a.m. I am teaching a FREE yoga class.  
See Facebook [invitation here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1535891640052776/).  
After my yoga class I am inviting friends and students to join me for a quick coffee at the Starbucks in the mall.  
Come first for some fun and fabulous free yoga. And after for some coffee and a chat (before I head out for my second yoga class that day).  
The other Turtles classes are also on Saturdays: June 4, June 18 and June 25 (all those classes will be from 9-10 a.m.)  
**Athleta Fashion Show**  
Tuesday, June 21 is Summer Solstice, first day of summer!  
It&#8217;s also [International Yoga Day Portland](http://internationalyogadayportland.com). It will be a world-wide celebration of International Yoga Day in Portland.  
International Yoga Day was inaugurated by the United Nations on December 11, 2014, and signed by 177 countries, including the United States.  
The event is in Pioneer Square from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The event will be free and fun.  
Lots of things are planned for that day, including free yoga classes for all levels, vendor booths, DJ Prashant and more, including an Athleta fashion show at 11:45 a.m., where I will be one of the models.  
The other models and I have some fun things planned and we&#8217;ve been working hard to make sure the show is amazing.  
If you are in the Portland area and canÂ take a break and come out, please do. If you have more time, come for a free yoga class, the fashion show and tour the vendor booths.  
You can register [for the day here](http://internationalyogadayportland.com/register).  
Come experience the wonderful culture of yoga and meet the awesome community that participates in it year round.  
I plan to get there early and get in a free class. And to get some booth touring in before the fashion show. And maybe lunch and a yoga class after.
