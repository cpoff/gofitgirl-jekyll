Two days into July and no workouts. I know that doesn&#8217;t seem like a big deal. But many challenges are already waiting for me. Out of town one weekend, visitors here two different weekends.  
And I don&#8217;t even want to get started on the caloric intake department. Hasn&#8217;t been so awesome lately. And being out of town and having visitors also means eating out a lot.
