    Friday's lunch consisted of baked zucchini, green onion, jalapeno and yellow hot mixed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar over brown rice.

As Bridget Jones once said: Have a sneaking suspicion &#8230; am also something of a genius in the kitchen &#8230;  
So this week I think I have been pretty good with being on a plan to eat healthy and keep up with exercise.  
I started back at yoga on Monday. Practiced yoga Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. Went to the gym today for two hours of spin, abs and body conditioning.  
On Thursday I had a work dinner, which consisted of wine, appetizers and an amazing dinner. Probably the only super unhealthy item I had was the delicious mushroom ravioli. Wow, was it good!  
Since Thursday was a higher calorie dinner I am trying to be aware and careful for the rest of the week (and I was careful coming up into Thursday).  
I had dinner plans with some girlfriends last night. We had Chinese and I knew I could be OK with steamed veggies and brown rice.  
For lunch yesterday I was craving something with balsamic vinegar. It&#8217;s one of my new &#8220;seasoning&#8221; obsessions. I found stuff in the fridge: zucchini, green onion, jalapeno and Â yellow hot. I cut them all up and mixed with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar and baked in the toaster over for about 15 minutes. I ate over brown rice, which had a little extra balsamic poured over. Man, was it good. I can rarely just throw something together and it tastes brilliant. But this really did. And it was low calorie, filling and healthy.  
I think I called my inner Bridget &#8220;Genius in the Kitchen&#8221; Jones. If you haven&#8217;t seen the movie (or read the book) you must.
