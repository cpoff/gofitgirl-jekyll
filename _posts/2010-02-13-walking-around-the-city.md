So I skipped spin today (well, skipped the gym all together). I was hanging and lounging with Mark and Suzy this morning.  
We headed to the city late this morning. We did a lot of walking &#8230; around Chinatown and a little into North Beach.  
So even though I have been kinda lazy and eating horribly at least I walked, right? (There has been wine drinking, beer drinking and pasta eating. Three of my favorite things.)
