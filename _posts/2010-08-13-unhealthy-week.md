This past week has been tough in so many ways. As you know my past weekend was full of eating lots of delicious and unhealthy food, drinking and no exercise.  
My work week was extremely busy. I did not exercise, I ate horribly and probably drank a little more than I should.  
Work is going to continue to be busy. But I somehow have to get the exercise in and not eat crap.
