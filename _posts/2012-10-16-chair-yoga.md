    The neck pillow takes up a lot of room. But in the end it is worth it as I have multiple purposes for it&#8211;neck pillow and lumbar pillow.

I flew out to Charlotte on Friday.  
I can experience lower back pain, especially when sitting or standing for a long period of time. So sitting on a plane is not always pleasant for me.  
Almost immediately into my roughly 5-hour flight to the East Coast my lower back started to ache.  
Once I was no longer sleeping I used my neck pillow as lumbar support and that seemed to help ease the discomfort.  
I was kicking myself (well, not literally, because really I could only kick the seat in front of me and that person would not be happy) for not reading Baxter&#8217;s post on chair yoga, which he wrote for the [Yoga for Healthy Aging blog](http://yogaforhealthyaging.blogspot.com/search/label/chair%20yoga%20sequence).  
I have now reviewed the post and think some of the poses are going to be more difficult in a small, cramped coach seat on a plane.  
But I think some are definitely possible. Such as Chair Cat; Chair Twist; Supported Forward Bend. Chair Seated Forward Bend/Hip Opener and Chair Backbend might be doable, but just a little more difficult as the yogi would need a little more space, especially in the seated forward bend.  
I fly back tomorrow morning. And I plan to practice some of the chair poses and my back starts to ache again.
