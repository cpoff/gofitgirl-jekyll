    My generic NyQuil, thermometer and new Roku box kept me company over my third mini cold in six weeks.

Yesterday morning I woke up around 6. On weekends if I wake up before 7 I usually laze around in bed until 7ish and hope to catch a few more zzzzs.  
I felt really tired and hoped to fall back asleep. I figured I needed the rest.  
Plus every single morning I have something to do. Monday through Friday I get up at 5:30. Monday through Thursday I am on a shuttle bus to work at 7 a.m. Friday mornings I hit the gym for a 6:30 a.m. class and then back home to work. On Saturdays Curt and I hit the gym. Sundays I get the grocery shopping done and then take a late morning yoga class.  
Yesterday I slept in until 9;30. About 1 Curt and I headed out to lunch. I felt a little off but figured I was just hungry.  
I had a couple of beers and a burger, which had a fried egg and bacon. Talk about getting my protein in.  
After lunch I still felt funky. (I figured it might have been the ginormous sundae I had the evening before. Eeekk! I went overboard with the dessert.)  
When we got home I changed into my jammies and got comfy to settle in for some TV watching. That&#8217;s when the aches and chills started. Eventually I decided to take my temperature. I had a fever of 101.  
I took today off and rested. My fever is gone. I slept most of the morning. I am grateful that The Husband recently got me a [Roku](http://www.roku.com) box and a subscription to HuluPlus. I&#8217;ve got Law & Order: SVU marathon all day all the time.  
This was my third mini cold in about six weeks. Let&#8217;s hope Third Time&#8217;s a Charm or hell, Three Strikes You&#8217;re Out. As long as I can stay healthy longer than a few weeks.  
I normally get sick once or twice a year.  
When I am sick I don&#8217;t exercise as I like to focus my energy on getting back to healthy. So you can imagine how frustrated I am with multiple illnesses. They have all been slightly different. First one was a regular (mini) cold; second was a (mini) chest cold and this last one was flu-like symptoms.  
I am feeling better and as long as the fever doesn&#8217;t come back I will be going to work tomorrow and yoga tomorrow night.
