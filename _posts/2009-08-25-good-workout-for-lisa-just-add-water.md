**Guest Post: Lisa**  
I had surgery back in April&#8211;doctors went up my nose to remove a <span id="lw_1251166705_0" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #0066cc; cursor: pointer; background-image: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; -webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial;">benign brain tumor</span> that had been playing merry havoc with everything <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>from my metabolism to my reproductive system&#8211;and naturally, there <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>were side effects. Some were unpleasant, like having a <span id="lw_1251166705_1" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">stuffy nose</span> and <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>the spins for four solid weeks while my sinuses drained, but the one <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>that I chafed against: no swimming.  
<span style="line-height: 15px;">&#8220;</span>You can&#8217;t go anywhere near the water until all the post-op drainage <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>is finished,&#8221; a nurse said when I called to ask about swimming <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>approximately four weeks and one day after my surgery.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />  
&#8220;Have you stopped blowing your nose yet? No? Then you can&#8217;t get into a <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>pool,&#8221; a nurse-practitioner said when I called to ask about swimming <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>approximately six weeks and one day after my surgery.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />  
&#8220;So long as you&#8217;re still getting a little sinus pressure, then you <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>shouldn&#8217;t swim,&#8221; my doctor said when I asked about swimming during my <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>follow-up appoiment seven weeks and one day after my surgery.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />  
Later that week, I decided &#8220;a little sinus pressure&#8221; was a highly <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>subjective metric. So I pulled my [Tyr](http://www.tyr.com/shop/women-c-30.html) on, and I jumped in the water<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />for the first time in two months. I had missed swimming, but until I <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>hopped into the diving well and felt the water rush around my head, I <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>hadn&#8217;t realized how physically deep the craving went.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />  
I&#8217;ve tried running; I have two USMC marathon medals and two blown-out <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>knees to prove it. I&#8217;ve put in time on the stairmaster and the <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>elliptical. I&#8217;ve tried classes in aerobics (it was the early 90s, <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>y&#8217;all). I got some small measure of mental satisfaction by making <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>myself do something I really didn&#8217;t enjoy. Who doesn&#8217;t love the chance <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>to be smug over how disciplined they are? However, I have rarely <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>_felt_ any sort of physical satisfaction with any exercise other than <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>swimming. Some people get runner&#8217;s high. My exercise high apparently <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>requires me to add water.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />  
In my single days, there was no better way to end the work week than <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>by hopping in the pool and knocking out a fast [1650](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_1650_in_swimming_when_it_comes_to_laps). I wasn&#8217;t <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>available on Friday nights; I was home washing (the chlorine out of) <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>my hair. If I&#8217;m traveling, I feel twitchy and ill-prepared unless I&#8217;ve <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>got my suit and goggles with me; I&#8217;d rather go without clean underwear <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>than bypass an opportunity to swim. When I moved out to <span id="lw_1251166705_2" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">California</span>, it <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>took me six days to find an apartment. It took me six hours to find a <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>health club with a pool within two blocks from work. The monthly <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>membership cost about half as much as my rent. I didn&#8217;t care. <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>Even on my worst days, I finish my laps feeling simultaneously calm <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>and energized; that feeling is worth a lot to me.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />  
I know that swimming stresses some people out. I used to teach adult <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>swim lessons, and I know that for some, not being able to stand <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>steadily on your feet is a big deal. For others, it&#8217;s the horrible <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>uncertainty of not knowing when you&#8217;ll suck in a snootful of water. <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>But that&#8217;s what I love about the sport. For a klutz like me, swimming <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>is the only time I feel completely at home in my physical self. And <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>focusing on the syncopation of stroking and breathing is a great way <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>to push your attention into the present&#8211;not the past that you can&#8217;t <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>change or the future you can&#8217;t control, but the here and now, where <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>every pulling stroke through the water is one more chance to get it <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>right.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />  
The doctor was right to caution me not to swim while the incision was <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>healing and my tender sinuses were recovering. But the real recovery, <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>I think, began happening once I could get back in the pool. I got my <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>equilibrium back the minute I couldn&#8217;t touch the bottom of the pool <span style="line-height: 15px;"></span>anymore.
