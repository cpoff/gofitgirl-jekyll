    While on Bora Bora in October I experienced a lot of sukha. I had quit my job about a month before and was really able to relax and enjoy the ease and happiness of my vacation.(And it was 2-for-1 cocktails. What&#8217;s not to love?)

Happy New Year!  
Wow, another year has gone by.  
2014 was a big year of change for me: entering into a new environment at work with many changes; completing my yoga teacher training; becoming a yoga teacher; teaching yoga classes; quitting my job; continuing to teach yoga classes; making the decision with The Husband to pack everything up and move to Portland; get certified as a SPINNING® instructor; get on the subbing schedule at my gym (for a month) to teach indoor cycling classes (one down, four to go); packing up the house and also doing a cleanse of donating many items and throwing a bunch of stuff away &#8230;  
(And let&#8217;s not forget our travels: Visiting family in Tucson and Missouri. Our annual March Madness trip to Vegas with good friends. A trip to Amsterdam with a good friend while visiting more good friends. And the ultimate&#8211;my 40th birthday trip to Bora Bora.)  
Many of the changes in 2014 were good. But some weren&#8217;t. I try to remind myself that everything happens for a reason.  
Change is inevitable. I used to think I wasn&#8217;t good with change. But what I have discovered is that I take on the emotion of change pretty personally. But I solider on and deal with it and am a lot stronger than I give myself credit for.  
One of my yoga teachers regularly talks about _sukha_ and _dukkha_ in class.  
[According to Wikipedia, sukha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukha) means happiness, ease, pleasure or bliss. [Dukkha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha) means suffering, anxiety, stress or unsatisfactoriness.  
When something is difficult in our lives (such as change) we don&#8217;t normally look for the ease in it. We usually run right for the suffering and stress. You know what I am talking about, right?  
(I&#8217;m finding my sukha today amongst moving madness by enjoying some down time.)  
I am not one for New Year&#8217;s resolutions. But every new month, new week and new year gives us a clean slate.  
If 2014 was a tough year for you, start 2015 with sukha. Sukha sounds kinda like this, aaaahhhh.  
Remember to exhale and celebrate ease and bliss as often as you can, especially during the hard times but also during the good times.  
I will try to remember to celebrate sukha as I prepare for my move, which is JUST TWO WEEKS AWAY!  
Ahhhhhhh.
