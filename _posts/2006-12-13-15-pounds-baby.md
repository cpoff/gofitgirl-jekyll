So last week was a sad week, I had gained a little weight at my Weight Watchers weigh-in. (Musta been all that beer I had in Phoenix.)  
But today at my WW weigh-in I lost and made my first WW goal.  
I have 9 pounds to go for my goal&#8211;and that is my new WW goal. Once I do I will go on a maintenance plan and then become a lifetime member.  
And this morning I thought my pants were much looser.
