Recently a plus-size model was featured on the front of People magazine with the quote: &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of my size.&#8221;  
Robyn Lawley is 6&#8217;2&#8243; and is a Size 12.  
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus-size_model) features Robyn in a photo and mentions her throughout the plus-size model article. Also mentioned is: Synonymous and interchangeable with plus-size model is &#8220;full-figured model,&#8221; &#8220;extended-sizes model,&#8221; and &#8220;outsize model.&#8221;  
Where do I begin? First, a woman who is at least 6 feet tall and a Size 12 is considered plus size? Wow! Then I was definitely a fatso years ago before I lost my 30+ pounds at 5&#8217;3&#8243;.  
Second, I find the term plus size offensive. The other terms mentioned above I find even worse than plus size.  
Why is there a need to define someone who has excess weight, curves, a big butt, thicker thighs, is tall, isn&#8217;t super skinny? We don&#8217;t call thin models a super-skinny model. They are just models.  
In October of 2006 I was at my highest weight ever. I didn&#8217;t feel good about myself. I hated shopping and buying clothes because I had to try them on and nothing ever looked good. I wasn&#8217;t obese but could definitely be healthier with some weight loss. I decided to join Weight Watchers. Between my doctor and my leader at WW we came up with a safe and achievable goal weight.  
Seven months later I was down 30+ pounds.  
I am pear-shaped and curvy on bottom. I have a tiny waist and a bigger butt and hips. It is just how I was built. Sometimes it is difficult to find pants that fit. But other than that I like my curves and the fact that I have a butt (even if at times I can&#8217;t squeeze it in to pants or a skirt).  
I am proud of my body. I hope other women are as well and don&#8217;t base their bodies on the airbrushed ones in magazines or what society tells us what a beautiful body is or isn&#8217;t.  
Before I lost weight I wore pants/bottoms anywhere from Size 10-14. Now I wear Size 4-8. Styles and quality of clothes will vary what size a person wears. If I wear something from Ann Taylor I tend to wear a 4. If I wear something from H&M I tend to wear an 8.  
I never considered myself plus size. Just someone whose metabolism did a 180 when I hit 25 and became sedentary with a desk job. And don&#8217;t forget the life of a copy editor&#8211;working second shift, getting a lot of meals on the go, staying up late, getting up late …  
It took me seven years to put on 30 pounds. And it took me seven months to take it off.  
Once while waiting in the waiting room at the doctor&#8217;s office I picked up a magazine and realized all the women were not super skinny, but shapely and curvy women. I was so excited to see this. I flipped back to the cover and realized it was a plus-size magazine. Imagine my disappointment.  
[Feminspire](http://feminspire.com/why-the-term-plus-size-should-be-out-of-fashion/) has this to say: Are cellulite, stretch marks, plump bellies, round shoulders, soft cheeks, and a fleshy butt too much to ask for? &#8230; We all see women and men of different sizes every day, why should it be any different in ads and magazine spreads?  
As [this article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2198766/Confidence-really-sexy-How-plus-size-Vogue-cover-girl-Robyn-Lawley-learned-love-body.html) states, confidence is definitely sexy. I totally agree &#8230; but why is it necessary to to put a label on Robyn? And why is it important to make sure it is known that she isn&#8217;t tiny or skinny or small or petite?  
Personally I think curves on a woman are what &#8220;real women&#8221; are all about. I realize some people are just naturally &#8220;skinny&#8221; or thin. But most women have curves, a butt, thick thighs, love handles, cellulite, saddle bags on the arms, etc.  
Robyn is a beautiful woman. I am glad that she is an example for girls, teens, young women and women like me. Feeling good about yourself and being confident are so important for all of us.  
The [Mail Online](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2198766/Confidence-really-sexy-How-plus-size-Vogue-cover-girl-Robyn-Lawley-learned-love-body.html) starts their article with this line:  &#8230; Robyn Lawley has become somewhat of supernova in the fashion industry, defying ideals of thinness equals beauty to star on the world&#8217;s most covetable magazine covers and ad campaigns.  
I think it is important to be healthy and a safe weight. Healthy, safe and realistic is different for everyone. But at the same time one shouldn&#8217;t obsess or compare themselves to anyone else. If your body is not supposed to be a Size 2 (which most bodies aren&#8217;t) be OK with that and find the size that fits you best.  
According to a [blog on WebMD](http://blogs.webmd.com/pamela-peeke-md/2010/01/just-what-is-an-average-womans-size-anymore.html) (written by a doctor), the average American woman is 5’4″, has a waist size of 34-35 inches and weighs between 140-150 pounds, with a dress size of 12-14. So the average women is what is referred to as plus size? Huh?
