Tonight I tried something a little different for dinner.  
I made about 2 cups of brown rice. I make my rice for the week at once&#8211;since it takes time to cook. (Still need to get a rice cooker.)  
My friends Becky and Cyrus recently tried a new recipe and they both shared it with me: [Zucchini &#8220;pasta.&#8221;](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/health/22recipehealth.html) I didn&#8217;t follow the recipe exactly. I used one zucchini (peeled length-wise) and heated with a little olive oil and seasoned with salt, pepper and Kickin&#8217; Chicken. Once the zucchini was cooked I put it over some brown rice and added some parm cheese to the top. (I didn&#8217;t have fresh&#8211;which would have been better.)  
My dinner was fairly healthy and filling, which is what I needed after taking a hardcore spin class.  
If you follow the recipe, Becky and Cyrus mentioned that they added chicken breast, which sounds good to me.
