Sorry for the lack of posts this week. This week has been an exhausting week. Work was crazy busy with a few nights of coming home and working some more.  
My goal was to hit yoga seven days in a row from last Friday through Thursday.  
I had to go into the office on Friday, which meant I wouldn&#8217;t be home in time for the evening yoga class. And I figured a day off would be just fine.  
I worked from home on Thursday and planned to attend a 10 a.m. yoga class to make it Day 7 of yoga. I was so busy that I wasn&#8217;t able to make it to class. And we had our Corporate Counsel in town from Switzerland. A group of us took him out for drinks and dinner. So no late night working or workout that day.  
So I skipped exercise Thursday and Friday.  
I slept in today until a little after 7, which is &#8220;late&#8221; for me. I still felt tired and knew I could go back to sleep if I really wanted. But I decided to get up and hit the gym. I did my usual 2-hour Saturday routine of spin, abs and then body conditioning.  
I took a much needed long nap this afternoon. And I purposely don&#8217;t have a lot planned this weekend and to just veg and recuperate.
