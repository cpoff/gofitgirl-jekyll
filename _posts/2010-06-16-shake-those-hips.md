I attended my third Zumba class tonight. I feel less dorky but still dorky.  
It is a lot of fun and an amazing and sweaty workout. Heidi keeps it fun. She cracks me up when she tells us to be sexy. I so don&#8217;t feel sexy. And the fact that the mirror is in front of us doesn&#8217;t really help. But whatever. I have a great time.  
One of the women who takes the class said tonight, I want to dance! The class is still kinda beginner. The thing is the pace is pretty fast for me. I am pretty OK with the pace right now. I am hoping after a few more classes I will feel even more comfortable.
