During my Saturday spin class (and actually her other classes as well) Jenn will yell out, is everyone good? Usually there is no response or a groan or a few weak goods.  
At some point the class started coming up  with a response we all recite together to respond to her question, Wow was unsuccessful. Awesome worked pretty well. We tried bitchin&#8217; today and that was worse than wow. Mostly because only a few of us yelled it out.  
I would link to Urban Dictionary for a definition. But I find some of the entries offensive. So you can look for it yourself. But just in case you don&#8217;t know what it means: similar to &#8220;awesome&#8221; or &#8220;bad ass&#8221;
