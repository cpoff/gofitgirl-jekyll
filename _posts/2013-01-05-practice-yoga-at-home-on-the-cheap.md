My friend Heather asked me if I could recommend some yoga videos for someone with limited resources.  
So I did some research and here&#8217;s the cool thing I found: [YogaGlo](http://www.yogaglo.com/index.php).  
The YogaGlo site says:Â Take more than 1,000 yoga classes on your computer or on your HD TV whenever you want, in the comfort of your own home or on the go.  
I reviewed as much as I could of the site without actually signing up for the free trial or a membership.  
I do have a friend who has used YogaGlo and thinks it is great. And I trust her opinion. And a few of the reviews I read on the site appear to be positive. There are a few glitches, but that has to be expected with the World Wide Web.  
The site has a great beginner center. Included are a variety of teachers, styles of yoga, levels and duration.  
You can sign up for a 15-day free trial for limited access to the site or you can register for full access for $18 a month.  
The videos I watched which show how to properly do a pose were well done. First they are listed under their English name and their [Sanskrit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) name. The person in the video explains how to practice the pose properly while also doing it.  
YogaGlo offers eight styles of yoga plus basics and meditation, which includes my three favorite and regular practices: Hatha, Vinyasa and Restorative.  
There are 20 regular teachers plus guests. I have heard of one of the teachers on the list. I don&#8217;t know most of them but that doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t amazing teachers. I have just never heard of them.  
It appears that they regularly record new classes to add online. (If you are in the LA area you can visit a class while they tape.)  
This site caters to all levels, all styles and durations of a classes: from 5 minutes to 120 minutes.  
The only negative I can see with using YogaGlo is you won&#8217;t have an actual teacher correcting you or helping you if you are doing a pose incorrectly. But that is the case with any home practice, whether doing it completely by yourself, using a video online or in the DVR or using YogaGlo.  
I can practice yoga on my own, spin by myself, do a body conditioning routine with no direction from an instructor. But I also work harder and have a better workout with instruction. And I think YogaGlo can give that.
