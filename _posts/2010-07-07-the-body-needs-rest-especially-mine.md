I came home tonight from work and the gym (Zumba) and I was just exhausted. I showered and got in my jammies.  
I got on the couch and cuddled up with a blanket and started watching [Three Sheets](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/health/22recipehealth.html). Then [Man vs. Food](http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Man_V_Food) came on. Adam was eating some spicy stuff and I started to think I wanted to eat something. But I didn&#8217;t want anything too high in calories. So I went with zucchini &#8220;pasta&#8221; again for dinner. The Kickin&#8217; Chicken gave it the spice I desired.  
I thought about having a beer&#8211;mostly to make me more tired and the idea was (and is) to sleep better tonight. I didn&#8217;t sleep so great last night, mostly because I was working on a work project in my sleep. UGH!  
But I decided against the beer and went with water. I am glad I made a better choice with my beverage. And I have to say I am getting sleepy because, well, I am tired. I was busy at work and had a headache most of the day. So my body is ready for some well-deserved rest.
