Curt and I got our Christmas tree yesterday.  
I love having a live tree. I know that isn&#8217;t environmentally aware &#8230; or maybe it isn&#8217;t so bad.  
[According to this article](http://wnewsj.com/Main.asp?SectionID=49&SubSectionID=156&ArticleID=171635) I found online:  North American real Christmas trees are grown in all 50 states and Canada. Eighty percent of all artificial trees are manufactured in China. Real trees are recyclable. Artificial trees contain non-biodegradable plastic.  
Every year that we have gotten a tree in the Bay Area (so about seven years) we have gotten our Christmas tree from the [Delancey Street Foundation tree lot.](http://www.delanceystreetfoundation.org/entertreedeco.php)  
[Delancey Street Foundation](http://www.delanceystreetfoundation.org) is a self-help organization for substance abusers, ex-convicts, homeless and others who have hit bottom. They run restaurants, moving companies, furniture making, Christmas tree lots and cafés and bookstores.  
These guys work hard and they seem happy to be working so hard.  
Sometimes you can be in such a bad place and someone gives you another chance or a job or a choice to help yourself with just a little boost.  
Most of the time people just need a little help. They need that encouragement to get out of that bad place.  
And I believe Delancey Street Foundation is doing just that.  
And if buying a tree from them helps give a boost then we will gladly do it.
