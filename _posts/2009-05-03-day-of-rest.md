Sundays are my regular day to take off from working out. I had an opportunity to have &#8220;fun&#8221; and do some cardio. But I decided to pass.  
I attended Lexie&#8217;s birthday party today at an [ice skating rink](http://www.oaklandice.com) in Oakland. I was a maybe in the skating department. And I ended up being a no. I played some games, hung out with Cooper, chatted it up with Mia and Todd and Mia&#8217;s stepmom, Mary. It was fun and chilly.  
I wasn&#8217;t able to go to my Friday evening Yoga class because I had to stay late at work. Bummer. Oh well, that does happen from time to time.  
I try to make sure that my workouts are a priority in my life. But sometimes other things in life take precedence and I have to accept that.
