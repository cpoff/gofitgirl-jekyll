    Egg nog lattes are yummy, but quite fattening. Alicia shares a lower cal, lower fat version. http://www.skinnytaste.com/2009/12/skinny-eggnog-latte.html

**Guest Post: Alicia**  
I have an addiction to [Starbucks eggnog lattes](http://www.starbucksmelody.com/2011/10/13/the-story-of-the-eggnog-latte-a-starbucks-tradition-since-october-1986/).  They are delicious and every November I look forward to buying my first eggnog latte of the year.  I think part of the appeal is because it’s seasonal so it makes it so much more special to me.  
Unfortunately this seasonal delicacy along with snacking on other holiday treats add to the fact that I eat too much junk during this time of year. And it also hurts my wallet.  
For a [12 oz. (tall) nonfat eggnog latte](http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/eggnog-latte?foodZone=9999#size=108517&milk=61&whip=NA) it’s $3.75 at 350 calories and 15 grams of fat. It’s quite pricey (even when I bring in my own mug and get 10 cents off, it’s still $3.65).  
Last year I did some research and discovered I could make my own at home for fraction of the cost and calories.  Trader Joe’s sells low fat eggnog for $2.69 a quart.  A half cup serving is 110 calories and only 1 gram of fat.  I found a recipe on [Sweet Savory Life](http://www.sweetsavorylife.com/).  I used low fat eggnog, nonfat milk, and left out the whipped cream.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Eggnog Latte – Eggnog Coffee Recipe</strong><br /> <strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong><br /> 2 shots espresso OR 1/2 cup of double/triple concentrated coffee<br /> 2/3 cup eggnog<br /> 1/3 cup milk<br /> sugar<br /> *optional whipped cream and nutmeg<br /> Variation: If you want to make this as an evening cocktail, add a shot of rum.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>DIRECTIONS:</strong><br /> Pour espresso/concentrated coffee into a mug and add steamed eggnog/milk mixture. If you prefer your eggnog latte sweeter, add a little sugar. Top off with whipped cream and a pinch of nutmeg. Happy Holidays -Enjoy!
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  *If you don’t have an espresso machine, do what I do most often. Just warm your eggnog/milk mixture in the microwave. Cook times may vary but I prefer heating mine for 2 minutes.
</p>

This year we are remodeling the kitchen so making an eggnog is just too much work.  So I just make coffee using espresso beans and just add lowfat eggnog.  
My addictions are satisfied, I eliminate the amount of junk I eat during the holiday, and my credit card statement looks better.  
Happy Holidays!
