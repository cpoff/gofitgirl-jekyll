    I made sure to take Child&#8217;s Pose as often as I needed to in class tonight.

I believe I am suffering from [adrenal fatigue](http://www.adrenalfatigue.org/what-is-adrenal-fatigue).  
[AdrenalFatigue.org](http://www.adrenalfatigue.org/what-is-adrenal-fatigue) says: Adrenal fatigue is a collection of signs and symptoms, known as a syndrome, that results when the adrenal glands function below the necessary level. &#8230; You may look and act relatively normal with adrenal fatigue and may not have any obvious signs of physical illness, yet you live with a general sense of unwellness, tiredness or &#8220;gray&#8221; feelings.  
We hear about celebrities going into rehab for exhaustion. Maybe that is a cover for substance abuse and maybe it is really for exhaustion.  
At one point today I felt the tiredness and exhaustion overwhelm me.  
The best solution I have found for adrenal fatigue is Restorative Yoga. I enjoy going to a full hour and a half class or when my yoga instructors, especially Vickie, adds a restorative yoga pose or two at the end of class.  
I recently attended Vickie&#8217;s [Restorative Yoga and Adrenal Fatigue workshop](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9699). It was an amazing discovery of feelings and emotions and a great way to &#8220;recharge.&#8221; And I am looking forward to the [next workshop in December](http://namasteoakland.com/programs/workshops/restorative).  
At my most intense point of exhaustion today I couldn&#8217;t fathom going to Hatha Yoga tonight. I decided to wait to see how I felt when I got home. But I also knew I would feel better after class. And the great thing about yoga is you can modify any pose or the whole class. I did modify a few poses tonight and took Child&#8217;s Pose as often as I felt like.  
And Vickie gave us &#8220;dessert&#8221; tonight with [Instant Maui](http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/c0.0.403.403/p403x403/564661_473413886026658_1194564928_n.jpg). I thought Vickie was making up the name of that pose. Ha! Apparently not. It was relaxing and a great way to end class and essentially my day.
