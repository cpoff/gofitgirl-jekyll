Yesterday was my last day of work for the year.Â Today I ran errands, did laundry and packed.  
I hit the gym for the noon spin class. It was good to get another workout in this week. (Long work days prevented me actually getting any workout in Monday or Tuesday.) After spin today I had an appointment for a massage. And it was wonderful. What a great way to end the work year and prepare for family gatherings.  
I am hoping while out of town for the holidays I will be able to attend a yoga class or two with my dad and his wife. And I am hoping to get some gym time in while staying at a hotel in Southern California.  
There will be a lot of eating (Mexican food) and drinking while going home for the holidays and normally just while out of town.
