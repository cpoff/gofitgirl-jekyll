I have been trying out different treat/snacks lately. Since it is almost summer here I have been having more ice cream.  
I had the regular Dreyer&#8217;s Fruit Bars and I had the [sugar-free Dreyer&#8217;s Fruit Bars](http://www.dreyers.com/brand/fruitbars/flavor.asp?b=135&f=2592). And last night I tried the [sugar-free Popsicle Ice Pops](http://www.popsicle.com/Products/Popsicle.aspx).  
The SF Dreyer&#8217;s are 25 calories. They are really tasty. And taste like they have real fruit.  
The SF Popsicle&#8217;s are 15 calories. They are fairly tasty. But they fall apart easily. Twice last night I had chunks fall off. So I guess I just have to be careful when I eat them.  
I think I like the Dreyer&#8217;s better. But I do like that the Popsicle&#8217;s are lower in calories.
