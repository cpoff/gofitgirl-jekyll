I had planned to go to spin tonight after work. I was super busy at work with multiple projects going on.  
Since my company is moving in a couple of weeks, this afternoon at work was designated as a packing/purging day. So I did a lot of moving, lifting, packing, wrapping, etc.  
And I ended up staying at work until almost 7 p.m., when my class would have ended.  
Bummer.
