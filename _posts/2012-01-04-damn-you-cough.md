    I definitely cover my cough (and sneeze). But enough with the coughing already, especially while I am trying to sleep. http://myadventuresintucson.blogspot.com/ 2011/11/cough.html

My cough seemed to calm down somewhat today. I took my 5:30 a.m. shot of Mucinex and then forgot to take my last morning shot.  
When I realized I had missed a dose I decided to hold off and see if my cough got worse. It did OK. And I kept it at bay with my yucky honey lemon cough drops.  
But I didn&#8217;t catch a break last night. I went back with the NyQuil and took it about 8 p.m. I got cozy and ready for bed (aka known as watching TV under the covers) in the spare room as I didn&#8217;t want to keep Curt up with my hacking. And I had my pillows propped. It seemed like as soon as I feel asleep I was awoken by my horrific cough, which just wouldn&#8217;t stop.  
I woke myself up many times during the night coughing.  
I was chatting with a co-worker today about my cough. He had all sorts of suggestions for me. Taking NyQuil? Yup. Drinking tea with honey? Yup. Drinking lots of fluids? Yup. Sleeping propped up? Yup. He gave up and told me to try whiskey. I told him I am not a whiskey fan, but maybe I could try rum.  
Anyone got any suggestions for me to keep this cold calm so I can get some sleep?
