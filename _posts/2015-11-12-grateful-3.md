I am excited to announce I will be teaching a special yoga class at [Turtles Yoga & Wellness](http://www.turtlesyoga.com) on Thanksgiving morning, which is two weeks away.  
My class titled: Celebrate Being Grateful is from 9-10:30 a.m.  
Join me on Thanksgiving morning for a yoga class where we practice gratitude while recognizing how blessed we are in this life.  
We will come together for a Hatha alignment-based practice as we move mindfully while breathing deeply.  
We will explore yoga poses that aid in digestion.  
We will also open our hearts with some supportive Restorative Yoga poses to end our class.  
When I still lived in Oakland I absolutely loved that the yoga studio(s) I regularly attended hosted Thanksgiving morning yoga classes. What a beautiful way to start the day and prepare us for what I call Crazy Time (end of the year and holiday season).  
My teaching schedule around the holiday is slightly modified.  
On Wednesday, Nov. 25 (day before Thanksgiving) my cycle class is canceled. But my 8 p.m. yoga class is still scheduled.  
On Thursday, Nov. 26 (Thanksgiving) I will have a sub for my morning cycle class. I will be teaching my special yoga class at Turtles that morning. My noon yoga class is still on the schedule. An my evening yoga class is canceled.  
See [My Classes tab](http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/) for any classes I am subbing, changes, updates, etc. to my teaching schedule.
