    Dinner tonight is raw spaghetti: Peeled strips of zucchini and carrot with a raw sauce, which has tomatoes, basil and other ingredients.

I survived Day 3 of my cleanse. I replaced my three meals with three green smoothies. I was a little hungry in the afternoon so I had an apple. Trying to keep it raw. It went much more smoothly than I thought it would.  
Last night I attended my regular Friday evening Vinyasa flow class with Lily. We did [moon salutations](http://ayurveda-florida.com/articles_ayurvedic_medicine_diet_lifestyle_dhanvantari_ayurveda_center_ayurveda_education_programs/moon_salutation_files/image004.gif) instead of [sun salutations](http://www.sivananda.org/images/sun-salutation.png). It was a nice way to end the week and for an evening class.  
One pose we did was called [dragon pose](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0c33EkgOvsk/TFDfGvVt03I/AAAAAAAAAaA/Lb0XL-nt3og/s1600/asana_dragon_low.gif). It was a nice stretch. And Lily mentioned it is a great pose for those of us who wear high heels.  
Today is Day 4 of my cleanse. I woke up with a slightly scratchy throat. I am thinking it is because of the raw fruits and vegetables. I tried to do some research online. I couldn&#8217;t find anything that is certain. But I think the scratchy throat is because my body is detoxing.  
I had a green smoothie for breakfast and lunch. I had some carrots for a snack this afternoon. For dinner I made raw &#8220;spaghetti.&#8221; I am eating half of it now. And will eat half later. Our upstairs neighbors are having a get together tonight. I plan to make an appearance. But you know, how fun can a party be when you can&#8217;t eat anything or drink anything except water or decaf tea?  
The raw &#8220;spaghetti&#8221; tastes pretty good. The sauce is delicious. I may even make it sometime and put it over real pasta. Or when I make my zucchini &#8220;pasta.&#8221; I like to saute zucchini, which I peel in strips to make it look like spaghetti, and mix it with seasonings and garlic and eat over brown rice. So yummy, healthy and filling. Yuuuuummm!  
Day 4 is supposed to be the toughest day. I think it is because it is roughly half way through. I feel pretty good. I am thinking the next three days will be challenging but definitely doable.
