work won.  
At some point this morning at work I got the feeling there was no way I was going to get out on time to make it to my 5:30 p.m. yoga class. I ended up working until a little after 7 p.m.  
Eventually I accepted it and knew the work that I had to get done. I had been to the gym four times already this week and am planning to hit my regular two hours tomorrow morning.  
I also have decided to finally use a gift certificate for the yoga studio in my neighborhood and take a class Sunday morning.
