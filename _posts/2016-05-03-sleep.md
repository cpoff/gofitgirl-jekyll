    I am almost through the more than 900-page book, The Historian, which is a fascinating read. Up next, something from the bookshelf

Recently I realized one night as I was reading my 900-page book before bed that I was finally sleeping better.  
For years I have had a battle with sleep. And lack of sleep and tiredness was winning.  
I usually fall asleep without an issue, but I wake up a lot (sometimes more than 10 times a night).  
I went to my doctor in November to discuss my sleep issues. Everything I was already doing (like going to bed every night around the same time and waking up about the same time in the mornings) was what I should be doing.  
But my doctor had one thing to add: Reduce screen time before bed.  
Screen time=iPhones, smart phones, iPads, tablets, computer, Kindle, TV, etc.  
My norm at the time and for years had been to fall asleep to the TV. From many years ago when I lived alone falling asleep to the TV was a comfort. And it was a bad habit I had continued until November.  
My doctor suggested I reduce my screen time one to two hours before bed. Two hours is extreme for me. So I&#8217;ve been doing at least an hour.  
My doctor told me it could take up to three months to take effect.  
I started it mid-November. About a month later I lost a student in my cycling class and my sleep was pretty messed up. I was emotionally exhausted and sleeping whenever I could get it in. I fell asleep almost every night with the TV on.  
But early January I started up the healthy habits once again.  And a couple of weeks ago as I was reading my ginormous book I realized my sleep had been better lately.  
I see a lot of friends complaining about insomnia, sleep issues, being tired, etc. on Facebook regularly.  
Friends, seriously, reduce your screen time. Don&#8217;t post on Facebook at 2 a.m. that you are having trouble sleeping. That blue light is altering your melatonin and hurting your sleep.  
For me it took three months.  
But since I started my healthier habits and I have [shared that information](http://gofitgirl.com/2015/12/screen-time/) with others. Some have tried reducing their screen time as well and they were sleeping better within a week or even a few days.  
Friends, please, please try it. If nothing else, you are living healthier habits. AND, maybe you will finally get to read those books you don&#8217;t have time for. I&#8217;ve been book &#8220;shopping&#8221; on my bookshelf.  
And when you wake up, please don&#8217;t get on the computer, phone, tablet. Maybe do a little yoga or pranayama (breath work) or meditate. Or even pick up that &#8220;big, boring book.&#8221;  
My sleep isn&#8217;t perfect. But it&#8217;s so much better.  
I&#8217;ve woken up many times with a book on my face. But that&#8217;s so much better than falling asleep with the TV on.
