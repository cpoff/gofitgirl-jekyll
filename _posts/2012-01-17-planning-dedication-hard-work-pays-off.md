    I was happy to see my dedication and hard work drop the numbers on the scale today.

Last week [I talked about how planning](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=8050) my meals and my exercise was keeping me on track.  
Well, the regular exercise and healthy eating has proven to be worthy. I got on the scale this morning and I lost 2.2 pounds from a week ago.  
I haven&#8217;t tracked my food or counted Points or calories. I just paid attention to what I was eating and I planned.  
I did a lot of cooking two weekends ago and most of my meals were fresh (hardly anything processed) with very little meat. I ate lots of fruits and vegetables. I drank water or tea.  
I have been limiting my caffeine intake as well as my alcohol intake and trying to keep the imbibing to the weekends.  
I plan to keep this up. We&#8217;ll see what happens next week.
