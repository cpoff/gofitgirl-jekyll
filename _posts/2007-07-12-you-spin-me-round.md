&#8230; not quite like a Record.

<div>
  I took a beginner spin class at the gym last night. Talk about killer! I took a spin class a long time ago when we still lived in Phx. and that class kicked my butt. Thankfully my gym has a half hour class for newbies.<br /> Let&#8217;s just say I will be taking the beginner class for a long time. The instructor told us the regular class is 4 times as hard. OK, just discourage me to take that one why don&#8217;t you! (My co-worker Judy and I took the class together. That made it a little easier, too.)

  It was an amazing cardio workout. I was sweating like a pig and concentrating on my breathing and holding my body the right way on the bike. It was a lot of work. </p>
