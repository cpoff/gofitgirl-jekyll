      I was recently in Boston, spending six fun days with my friend Debbie. Traveling not only means seeing different parts of the country or world, but it also means trying the different foods that the area is known for. With all the eating I was thrilled that Boston is a “walking city” so that I could walk off some of the food I knew I would be eating. Basically we left the hotel around 9 a.m. and either walked or took public transportation and explored different areas of the city and didn’t get back until 10 p.m. It was tiring, but worth it.<br /> On our first day we discovered Charles Street. It’s a cute street with local vendors and restaurants. I had read about a restaurant called Figs. They are known for their prosciutto and fig thin crust pizza. I thought it was an unusual combination, but decided to give it a try. It was delicious! The saltiness and the sweetness went so well together.<br /> The next day we followed the Freedom Trail. It spans about 2 1/2 miles and takes you all over the city seeing 16 historical sites such as Paul Revere’s House, the Boston Massacre and Quincy Market. At Quincy Market we decided to try a local sandwich called a lobster roll for lunch and, of course, I just had to have the clam chowder. It was delicious. In fact, it was so good, I had both again for dinner! This time at a restaurant called Legal Seafood recommend by Ann.  What I had for dinner was even better than what I had for lunch. I generally do not eat mayonnaise or cream, but it was worth it.<br /> On the third day we spent most of the day at the John F. Kennedy Museum. It was the best place I visited in Boston. It’s a big museum so lots of walking from room to room. After the museum we went to the Samuel Adams Brewery for a free tour. It was a lot of fun and best of all we got to sample beer. With this great buzz going we headed over to Chinatown. It’s smaller than the one in San Francisco and it can be easily covered by foot. It was dinnertime. Debbie had read online about a Chinese seafood restaurant called Peach Farm, which had great reviews. We found the staff to be extremely friendly and warm. We ordered the lobster with ginger and scallions, scallops and Chinese broccoli. Food was excellent and inexpensive.<br /> The next day we traveled to Salem. We spent most of day walking around and exploring. For lunch I had ahi tuna and lobster bisque while Debbie had a fish sandwich. Later we decided to go shopping at the Prudential Center and at Copley Place. The malls were huge so we took our time walking around. At this point we were hungry. We received several recommendations to go to Summer Shack for dinner. Since it was close to the mall we decided to try it. We had steamed whole lobster, crab cakes and Boston baked beans. Food was great.<br /> On the fifth day we hit the Seaport area and went to the Harpoon Brewery for a tour. The tour was extremely informative and we learned a lot about the company and well worth the $5 we each paid. During and after the tour we got to sample literally everything they had available on tap. How great is that?!?!? Our next visit was the Waterfront area. It was a beautiful day to be by the water. As we walked on, somehow we hit the North End or the Italian part of town. It reminded me of North Beach in San Francisco. We noticed a lot of people with a box of goodies from Mike’s Pastries. After speaking to one of the locals we found out it was popular Italian pastry shop. I ordered a slice of Boston cream pie. It wasn’t quite my cup of tea, but I was happy I tried it. For dinner we headed toward Charles Street to try another local Italian restaurant called Artu. Debbie had linguine with clams while I had the linguine with seafood. Delicious! Afterward we headed toward Cheers for beer.<br /> On our final day we went to Cambridge to visit Harvard and MIT. We roamed the campuses and decided to eat at a Mexican/Cajun restaurant called Borders Café. Debbie had the seafood enchiladas and I tried the crawfish dish. Then it was back to the hotel to pick up our luggage and head to the airport back to San Francisco.<br /> I had a great time in Boston. I learned a lot of American history and got to sample the local restaurants and dishes. It’s fantastic that Boston is a walking city since it means I was able to burn off some of the food I ate. At this point I’m actually sick of food and eating so I’m happy to be back home and get back to my normal eating habits.<br /> *********<br /> Thanks so much Alicia for sharing this with us.
