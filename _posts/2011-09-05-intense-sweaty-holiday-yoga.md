    Whoever says yoga isn't a real workout, I say you're wrong. Check out my top after Power Vinyasa class.

At Namaste yoga studio there was only one class because of the holiday. I attended the 10 a.m. Power Vinyasa class.  
Power Vinyasa is an intense, hard, good, hot, sweaty, always moving class. Sweat was literally dripping off of me during class. My top was soaked (see pic to the left) as was the towel I brought to wipe up my sweat.  
The class was packed today. We had a little more than 40 in the tiny studio. Our mats were an inch to 2 inches from each other.  
After class I was tired, exhausted, soaked and hungry. I came home and took a quick shower. And then Curt and I headed out for brunch and a beer.  
Between a full meal, an intense workout and the one beer I was ready for a nap. And so that is what I did.

Yesterday we had Emily sub for Ashley&#8217;s Vinyasa Flow class. Emily told me the type of yoga she taught us. But I couldn&#8217;t remember the name. I found out she teachesÂ [Jivamukti Flow](http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/jivamukti.htm), which is a Vinyasa style practice, according to About.com. And that makes total sense since I thought it was taking a Vinyasa Flow.
