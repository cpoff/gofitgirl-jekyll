Thank you to everyone for the awesome and great comments for the latest Comment Contest Tuesday. I really enjoyed reading them. And from what it seems you all enjoyed writing them.  
I am very intrigued by the comfier yet still stylish heels that were mentioned numerous times. I plan on looking into them.  
I really want to thank you all for your comments. It shows your support to Go Fit Girl!  
I work hard to write intriguing stuff. And many of my posts take hours to write when you include the research I do.  
I consider this blog to be &#8220;my other job,&#8221; which I don&#8217;t get paid for. Man, I wish I did.  
Maybe one day my blog will get enough ad revenue that I can quit my day job and just devote myself to Go Fit Girl! But for now I will just fit it in when I can (and get up at 5 a.m. for the job that makes me the real bucks).  
You are all Go Fit Girls! YEA!!!! Woot-woot!
