I defrosted [two chicken breasts](http://fosterfarms.com/products/product.asp?productcode=90563) for dinner tonight. When I got home from the gym I threw them in a baggie with some fat free Italian dressing (tip from my mother-in-law) and let them marinate.Â I let them marinate for about 45 minutes and then cooked them on the George Foreman grill.  
Julie, from our cooking class, [Cooking with Julie](http://cookingwithjulie.com), said you really shouldn&#8217;t marinate anything longer than an hour. Last time I did the chicken marinated in the dressing I had it together for at least 24 hours. Way too long. The marinade or dressing or whatever you use will start to cook your meat. So when I grilled the chicken it came out dry and took longer to cook because the outside was ready, but the center wasn&#8217;t.  
Today it was perfect.  
Along with the chicken I had green beans and salad. Curt had some bread and butter and green beans with his chicken. It was a yummy, filling rather healthy dinner. And it was easy to make. That is what I like. I am busy and I come home from work and or the gym tired. But I want something healthy, too. So this was a perfect dinner to make and eat.
