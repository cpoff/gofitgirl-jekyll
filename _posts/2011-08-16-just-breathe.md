One of the many benefits of practicing yoga is learning so many new ways to breathe.  
When I am aboard a plane and we are taking off I do what I call my yoga breathing, which makes me feel more relaxed and less nervous.  
When I get stressed out or irritated or upset I try to remember to inhale and exhale slowly and calmly.  
A co-worker and I attended a webinar today that taught us how to deal with chaos and stress and how to make things more positive and in control.  
I was telling my co-worker about my breathing techniques and as soon as I did the training started talking about how breathing can help in stressful situations. (They even mentioned yoga.)  
[This link](http://tutelasalute.info/pdf/Yoga/6.pdf) explains some of the breathing techniques we use in yoga practice. I probably find theÂ Sukha Pranayama the most relaxing for me when trying to calm myself down.  
I have [exercise-induced asthma](http://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/exercise-induced-asthma). I am working on making my lungs healthier. I am making them stronger with regular exercise. But my breathing and my breathing techniques are getting better with my regular exercise and breathing techniques I am learning in yoga.

I have recently learned to breathe into my back. I don&#8217;t know how to explain how I do it. I can just do it.  
In yoga while in a pose, the instructor will ask us to breathe into a particular area. You learn how to breathe through a tight spot or ease yourself into a challenging pose.  
Also sometimes while in a pose the instructor will place their hand on your back and ask you to breathe into their hand. I think that is what really got me to concentrate and learn to breathe into my back.  
Even if you don&#8217;t take yoga or have no interest in reading up on the breathing techniques. If you notice yourself upset or emotional just stop and breathe. Just breathe evenly: 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out will make a huge difference. Try it. You will be surprised.
