    The recipe made four Sweet Potato Pancakes, which ended up being two lunches for me along with a side salad. (The pancakes heat up great the next day.)

One of the great things about being a teacher is the relationship you develop with students.  
Sometimes I have some pretty personal in-depth conversations.  
Other times things are light hearted and fun. People have questions for me or give me some tips.  
Recently after one of my yoga classes my students and I were talking about losing weight and maintaining weight with healthy eating and exercise, including a regular yoga practice.  
We talked about our go-to snacks and other things we love to eat.  
We started talking about what I am calling produce pancakes.  
Simple, healthy, delicious and filling.  
The first recipe I tried were for the **Sweet Potato Pancakes**:

  * 1 large sweet potato
  * 2 eggs

I microwaved the sweet potato until it was soft enough to scoop out. Sweet potato &#8220;guts&#8221; went into a bowl with 2 eggs. Whipped everything together.  
Depending on if you want sweet or savory you can add seasoning to fit your tastes. (Savory: garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, etc. Sweet: cinnamon, pumpkin pie spices, etc.)  
Sprayed some cooking spray into a skillet. Poured the &#8220;batter&#8221; in skillet.  
The recipe made four pancakes.  
The next day I tried the **Banana Pancakes**:

    Banana pancakes can be breakfast or a yummy snack.
  </p>
</div>

  * 1 banana
  * 1 egg

Mash up the banana in a bowl and whip with egg. Spray cooking spray into a skillet. Pour the &#8220;batter&#8221; in skillet.  
Makes two pancakes. I added a little peanut butter on top.  
Super yummy as a snack or even breakfast.  
I have made the Sweet Potatoes Pancakes twice and the Banana Pancakes at least three times.
