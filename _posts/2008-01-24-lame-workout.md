I went to the gym after work last night ready for a hard and sweaty cardio workout. Didn&#8217;t happen. Almost all of the machines were taken &#8230; again.  
So I walked on the treadmill&#8211;I hate running. I still felt it and at least I did something. But I had almost talked myself out of going to the gym. I will be happy when the gym is back to normal.  
  
I am going to take the 1 p.m. yoga class today.
