    My foldable water bottle easily attaches to my purse. And easily folds inside it as well.Â

Being from Arizona I have always known how important water is to stay healthy and hydrated and safe. (Ever heard of [heat stroke](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/heat-stroke/DS01025) or [heat exhaustion](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/heat-exhaustion/DS01046)? That stuff is real.)  
And now that I regularly drink at least 64 ounces a day (but usually more&#8211;today I have consumed almost a gallon of water) my body needs it. And I notice pretty quickly if I am dehydrated or haven&#8217;t had enough water.  
For the past couple of days the weather has been exceptionally warm, especially for this time of year in the Bay Area.  
I went to a Giants baseball game yesterday. I didn&#8217;t take my big purse, which I normally carry and can fit my Camelbak water bottle in quite easily.  
I wanted to bring water with me as I would be doing a lot of walking and it was warm out. But I didn&#8217;t want to carry one of my Camelbak water bottles as they are a little bulky without my bulky purse to store them in.  
I grabbed my [foldable water bottle](http://vapur.us/shop/shades), filled it up and attached to my small purse. My foldable holds 12 ounces (or how I like to refer to it, 1 1/2 servings of water).  
It was really warm at the game. I had just one beer and made sure to keep refilling my foldable.  
I kept myself hydrated during and after the game. And while practicing yoga.
