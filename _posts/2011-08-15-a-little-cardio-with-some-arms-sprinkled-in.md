    Ann doing bicep curls.

My inner thighs are still sore from Saturday&#8217;s step ups during circuit training in body conditioning. I am walking around pretty funny.  
I still wanted to do some cardio today. So I did 30 minutes of intervals on the espinner.  
After my cardio I did some weights for my arms, especially since Saturday&#8217;s body conditioning had more of an emphasis on legs.  
I didn&#8217;t have a lot of time today. So I did bicep curls (example of me in the picture to the left), [lateral raises for my shoulders](http://exercise.about.com/od/exerciseworkouts/ss/shoulderexercis_2.htm) and [tricep curls](http://www.abc-of-fitness.com/training-with-free-weights/triceps-curl.asp).  
If I am still sore tomorrow I will try to be careful with the cardio and legs again and put an emphasis on working some other arm muscles.
