    I would say at least 50% (and that is a low estimate) of the women at the golf course yesterday were wearing boots. Walking a hilly golf course in anything but comfortable shoes seems ridiculous to me.

Curt and I drove down to Monterey on Friday night.  
That&#8217;s one of the great things about our life and lifestyle &#8230; our friend [Tag](http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.23497.tag-ridings.html), who is a professional golfer, texted Curt on Monday night asking if he should save tickets for us for the weekend. Before I hit the sack we had decided that yes, we would come.  
Walking a golf course is challenging and there is a lot of standing around, too.  
The first time I ever walked a golf course was probably 2006 and I was about 30 pounds heavier than I am now. That was the first time I met Tag and am now happy to be a regular supporter.  
According to Swifty, Tag&#8217;s caddie, [Pebble Beach](http://www.attpbgolf.com) is about 6 miles. Tag teed off on Hole 10, which meant Curt and I had to walk all the way in &#8230; and Tag&#8217;s last hole was 9 &#8230; Yea, so we did a lot of walking.  
Besides the challenge of walking the course there is also a lot of temptation with food and booze. I also have to be careful and try to maintain decent water intake while being in the sun and drinking and walking.  
I had told myself that if I wanted to eat and drink whatever I wanted over the weekend I could. And starting tomorrow I would be back on track.  
I have had fun and enjoyed my food and booze. But I decided I didn&#8217;t need to go nuts. (I usually feel terrible afterward and wonder how I used to do this ALL the time.)  
While at the golf course I had a beer, a bloody Mary, one dog and a soft pretzel along with half  muffin and a hot chocolate (though that was ordered as a cappuccino) and coffee in the morning to keep warm.  
Curt and I had dinner last night with Tag and Swifty. I looked at the menu ahead of time and picked out the [Griglia Mista Di Pesce](http://www.cibo.com/menu.htm#Link000033Context): Grilled Jumbo Prawns, Sea Scallops and Seasonal Fish, Roasted Pepper Couscous, Balsamic Reduction, Spaghetti&#8217;d Squash.  
My dinner was delicious and fairly healthy. Wow, it was really good. Along with my dinner and part of The Husband&#8217;s salad I had red wine. I figured two glasses would do me just fine.  
While dining  someone came up to chat with Tag. Later in the evening our server came to our table with a round of drinks. Tag&#8217;s friend had bought the table drinks. And it would be rude to not imbibe, right?  
Unfortunately, Tag didn&#8217;t make the cut. So today is a lazy and loungy morning. I actually slept in. I rarely get to do that. It was nice. Curt and I went to Starbucks earlier and I had my soy latte and oatmeal.
