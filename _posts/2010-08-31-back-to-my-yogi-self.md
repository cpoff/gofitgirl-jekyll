Today on my lunch break I took a yoga class at my gym. I used to regularly take the Tuesday afternoon yoga class. It was a great class and much needed.  
I realized that I hadn&#8217;t taken a yoga class in a little more than two months. It was an amazing workout, really got me grounded and was great for some variety.  
Yesterday I took the noon spin class, today I took yoga at 1 p.m. and tomorrow the plan is Zumba after work. I like the variety and need to mix it up a bit. My plan is to try to make it to two daytime classes during the week&#8211;especially since I have been working some late nights. It seems a little easier to sneak away during the day then to leave right at 5 or 5:30.
