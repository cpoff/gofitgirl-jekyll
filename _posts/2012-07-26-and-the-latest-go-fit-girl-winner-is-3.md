&#8230; Nicole!  
Thanks to Nicole and Alicia for [their great comments](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9544#comments). I loved what you both wrote and am thankful for you both taking the time to comment. Especially Nicole!  I mean, wowza.  
I love the idea of setting the timer for 5 minutes and getting the whole family to do a quick pick up. It makes it a little fun and gets everyone to participate, not just mom and/or wife.  
This is probably my favorite thing Nicole mentioned: The house doesn’t have to be showroom quality – it just has to be clean and safe and comfortable.  
Alicia, I am with you on the planning with the grocery shopping. For some reason I absolutely hate grocery shopping. If I could do what Alicia does: one thing I found that works for me is to grocery shop in the mornings on the way to work &#8230; I would do it.  
I used to shop on Saturdays after the gym. But it is nuts then. So I go Sunday mornings before yoga. It is calm and quiet and I get it out of the way early.  
There is a class at the gym that starts at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday nights (or like tonight I met my friends Jenn and Monica for a workout, which also starts at 6:30). I get back to Emeryville on the work shuttle about 5 or 5:10. So I have time to kill. Today I went to Target and then I also did some cardio at the gym before the girls met up. In the past I have also visited Trader Joe&#8217;s. I just stick a cooler in the trunk and put all the cold items in there and they keep each other &#8220;refrigerated.&#8221;  
One of my biggest time savers is cooking a big batch of something over the weekend: brown rice, oatmeal, root veggies and lentils, soup &#8230; Then I have the tupperware ready in the fridge and I can throw into my lunch bag for work or pull something out in the evening for dinner.  
And Nicole, I liked your mention of how important it is to eat healthy and to take time out to take care of yourself and make sure you get to yoga regularly&#8211;because you feel better and are a better person when you do.  
Thanks again ladies for your comments.
