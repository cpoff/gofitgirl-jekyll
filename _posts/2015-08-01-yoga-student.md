    I call this Ultimate Savasana. I look pretty comfy and blissed out, eh? Thanks to Sefana and Rachel for making me feel this way while attending their yoga classes at Turtles this week.

Twice this week I headed to [Turtles Yoga & Wellness](http://www.turtlesyoga.com) and took yoga classes. I was a student and not the teacher.  
I do truly love teaching.  
And I have a regular home yoga practice.  
But when you get to take a class and let someone else come up with a plan and you get to discover things in your body and learn new things it can be absolutelyÂ amazing.  
I really tried to let myself go and just be.  
Sometimes when I am in a yoga class I think about how I would have done it differently (or dare I say, better).  
But this week I let all of that go and I really enjoyed being a student, while also picking up a few things I will use as a teacher in my classes.  
I am hoping to take a class or two a week at Turtles regularly.  
I took Sefana&#8217;s Slow Flow on Tuesday at 10 a.m. I liked the pace of the class. I worked but in a slow and mindful way. I felt so relaxed when class was over.  
Last night I was able to take Rachel&#8217;s Restorative & Yoga Nidra class. I need more Restorative in my life. (We all do!) Rachel has a beautiful voice and got me totally blissed out. I felt so good. So good, in fact, I fell asleep.  
If you are in the Portland area and haven&#8217;t checked Turtles out yet, what are you waiting for? Come visit this beautiful space and take a class with me or one of the many other amazing teachers.
