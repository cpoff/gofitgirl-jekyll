Last week I started off the week right with yoga on Sunday and spin on Monday.  
The plan was to take the evening spin class on Tuesday. But Tuesday afternoon I started to get a sore throat. I decided to err on the side of caution and take it easy that evening. I came home had a healthy dinner, drank lots of water, took it easy and took some Nyquil for bedtime.  
By Wednesday morning I realized I had a mini cold and lucky for me it stayed that way. So I decided for the rest of the week to take it easy.  
Friday night was my company holiday party and fortunately for me I felt pretty OK and attended and had a great time. Then Saturday Curt and I headed to Portland and I decided to not even pack workout clothes as I was still a little snotty.  
Yesterday I attended yoga and today I took the noon spin class. The class was good and hard and full. Seven&#8211;SEVEN&#8211;people had to be turned away.
