For me, the simple answer is no. When I don&#8217;t feel well I don&#8217;t work out. I feel that my immune system needs rest and it needs to work on getting healthy and nothing else.  
I have a slight cold and I haven&#8217;t worked out since Sunday.  
I did a little research to see what experts thought. Some agreed with me and others felt that the common cold was OK to take to the gym.  
According to this [site, you can exercise if you have a cold, but no fever](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/exercise/AN01097). Though Dr. Edward T. Laskowski says you should listen to your body.  
<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">Dr. Rick Kellerman says, &#8220;</span></span></strong></span></span><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2006-11-09/health/HM.ill.exercise_1_flu-shot-intense-workout-germs?_s=PM:HEALTH">Even though it may be tempting to not break an exercise routine, working out may actually prolong the illness</a>.&#8221;</span></span></strong></span>  
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">And Shazia Khan says pretty much the same thing as Dr. Laskowski about how <a href="http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_julieshealthclub/2009/03/exercise-that-cold-.html">you can exercise if you have no fever and you cold is above the neck</a>.</span></span></strong></span>  
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">Liz Applegate says, <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=51085">forget about what you might have heard about trying to perspire your way back to better health</a>.</span></span></strong></span>  
And WebMD says you can [exercise when you have the common cold, but stay home when you have a fever or the flu](http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/when-not-to-exercise).  
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">If you do decide to work out at the gym be much more careful with spreading your germs. Wash hands more, disinfect yourself and the equipment. Make sure to drink lots of water, more than normal. </span></span></strong></span>
