Yesterday was my Day 7 of my week with WW. So whatever Flex points I have left I gotta use them or lose them. Well, I still had a lot of points at dinnertime.  
So I made some pasta with olive oil, garlic, mushrooms and brocolli. Yum! And I had a honkin&#8217; 24 oz. beer, which was a gift. Gulp, gulp!
