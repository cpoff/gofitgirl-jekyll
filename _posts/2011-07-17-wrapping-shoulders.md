In many yoga positions you are reminded to wrap your shoulders, whether in Downward Facing Dog, Warrior I, [High Lunge](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2492), Crescent Lunge, etc.  
I have noticed when I am on the spin bike if I wrap my shoulders it prevents me from bringing my shoulders up to my ears. Wrapping my shoulders keeps my upper body relaxed while spinning, especially when I am climbing, working on endurance or sprinting.  
In Forrest Yoga we work a lot of abs. Kristin really emphasizes us wrapping our shoulders during the abs practice. A fews weeks ago during my regular Saturday abs class I decided to wrap my shoulders. I was amazed at the results. I was able to crunch higher and deeper.  
Who knew that such a small move like wrapping my shoulders could help me in so many of my exercise routines.
