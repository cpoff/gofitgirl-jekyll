Today in my Vinyasa flow glass we focused on binding and twisting.  
This [Yoga Journal article](http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2734) gives a great and lengthy description of a Hatha practice while binding.  
The [noose pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/937) is a bind and a twist. We didn&#8217;t quite do this pose today. We did a bind while in a lunge. (Among many other binds and twists.)  
Yoga Journal states the following list of benefits one gets from practicing the noose pose:

  * Stretches and strengthens the ankles
  * Stretches the thighs, groins, and spine
  * Opens the chest and shoulders
  * Stimulates the abdominal organs
  * Improves digestion and elimination
  * Improves posture
Binding and twisting massages the internal organs and is detoxifying. [This article](http://laura-susan-henry.suite101.com/benefits-of-binding-in-yoga-poses-a181567) discusses the many benefits of binding.  
I am starting to wonder if my yoga instructors are preparing us for the holiday gorge fest that we are about to embark on. I talked about the [twisting we did in Baxter&#8217;s Hatha class](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=7212) on Wednesday night.  
Another preparation for the season that begins &#8230; really now, you know, the crazy holiday season, end of the year at work &#8230; I made sure to attend the restorative class tonight. I really enjoy that class. Today I physically relaxed just fine, but my mind didn&#8217;t. And eventually I got antsy and wanted to start moving around. But it was still a relaxing class and I feel ready for bed and my short workweek.
