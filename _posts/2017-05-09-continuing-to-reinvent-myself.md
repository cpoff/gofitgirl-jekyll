<a href="http://gofitgirl.com/2017/05/continuing-to-reinvent-myself/2017-intentions-letters/" rel="attachment wp-att-15764"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-15764" src="http://gofitgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-intentions-letters-231x300.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="300" /></a>At the end of my yoga teacher training in May 2014 we did an exercise in class where we pretended like we were all getting together a year later for a reunion.  
We talked about what we **did**. The idea was if we said it as if it did actually happen it would make it more real. We were advised to write a letter to ourselves to read in a year, which I did.  
I wrote to myself on May 9, 2014 with instructions on the envelope that I could open the letter on May 8, 2015 or later. I opened that letter May 8, 2015.  
I read the letter a year later ([and wrote about it here](http://gofitgirl.com/2015/05/fantasy/)) and wrote myself a second letter to be read on May 8, 2016 or later.  
I opened that letter last year and [posted about it on May 9, 2016](http://gofitgirl.com/2016/05/may-8/).  
<span id="sample-permalink"></span>I stated intentions in my third letter (with some edits) to the following:

  * I will reduce my yoga class teaching schedule to make it more manageable for me physically, mentally and emotionally. **DONE. My schedule is ever changing and I continue to find the right balance for me. Starting soon I will be back to having two days off and plan to keep that. **
  * I will reduce my cycle classes I teach and become a student of cycle much more often&#8211;at least once a week. **DONE. At the time I wrote this intention I was teaching five cycle classes a week. I was down to three classes at the end of 2016 and added a fourth in early 2017. By mid-May I will be back to three a week. **
  * Karma Yoga relationship/program established. **I have done a little work/fundraising with Living Yoga. But still figuring out my Karma Yoga. **
  * GFG! and newsletter going strong. **Blog has slowed down. But newsletter continues on a monthly basis.**
  * Private clients continue to grow, especially since I am teaching less. **Private clients are more occasional. But there is opportunity to grow that. **
  * Office yoga continues. **DONE and continues.**
  * Continue to be a student of yoga. **DONE. Not as often as I would like.**
  * Start my RYT 300 teacher training. **The TT I want to attend has not started up yet. When it does I plan to be there.**
  * Plan trip to Italy. **DONE. Planned and getting ready to go later this month.**
  * Teaching workshops on props and Restorative Yoga. **Half DONE. I taught a Restorative yoga workshop in December 2016. I plan to teach more Restorative workshops at the end of 2017 and a prop workshop early 2018.**
  * Will have earned my &#8220;E&#8221; in my E-RYT 200. **DONE. The &#8220;E&#8221; represents experienced and that I have taught at least 1,000 hours of yoga. I hit that number during my special Christmas Day donation yoga class. **

And I wrote myself a new (the fourth) letter today and will read it in a year and see what has become, changed and grown.
