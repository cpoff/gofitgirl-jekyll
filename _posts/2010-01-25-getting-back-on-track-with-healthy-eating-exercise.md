So today started yet another round of me getting back on track with my health and fitness.  
I went to my morning yoga class today.  
My menu has been: Cheerios with blueberries and strawberries (love summer fruit!); cup of coffee with Silk creamer; Pesto Chicken Lean Cuisine and salad with spritzer; piece of cheese and turkey jerkey; orange; and for dinner: brown rice with Brussels Srpouts and a Boca burger. There have been a couple of Coke Zeros thrown in (one regular and one vanilla). So far 7 servings of water.  
I also weighed myself this morning. I seem to jump around these same 5 pounds. But that&#8217;s OK. So I would like to lose 5 pounds to get back to my goal weight.
