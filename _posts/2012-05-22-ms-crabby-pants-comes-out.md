Work has been busy, exhausting, overwhelming, frustrating, etc. lately.  
Sometimes I deal with stress well and other times I don&#8217;t.  
I have been really trying to and focusing on [practicing yoga &#8220;off the mat&#8221;](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-4111/5-Ways-to-Practice-Yoga-Off-the-Mat.html) while at work the past few weeks.  
Sometimes I am successful and other times not so much.  
I wrote about [practicing yoga off the mat a couple of weeks ago](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9326) as well.

    I took a picture of this magnet hanging in a store in my neighborhood. I think it is hilarious.

I have been focusing on my breathing and to not instantly react or say something but to take a breath or two or choose my words wisely or choose not to say anything at all. Sometimes I am successful and sometimes I am not.  
And when I am not successful Ms. Crabby Pants comes out &#8230;  
But I am working on it and thinking about it almost constantly.  
I wonder if the excess caffeine is a good idea or a bad idea? Hmmm.  
I have to say that I know my spinning and yoga practice are helping to keep it somewhat at bay. I am able to work out some of my frustrations as well as work on my breathing and practicing calmness.
