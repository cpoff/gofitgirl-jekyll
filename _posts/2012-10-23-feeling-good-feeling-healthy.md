    Dinner looked a little like this tonight: quick, easy, filling and fairly healthy. (No butter, just Pam cooking spray.)

Yesterday was my first day back toward a healthy lifestyle. I am getting back into my regular exercise routine along with much better food choices.  
I was a little shocked when I stepped on the scale and saw the weight gain in my four weeks off the healthy lifestyle wagon.  
I have felt so tired and unhealthy lately.  
I was so ready to get back to a healthy routine.  
I think what will keep me in a regular exercise routine and not stuffing my face (and feelings) with junk food and booze will be remembering how I have been feeling recently.  
I just didn&#8217;t feel good, didn&#8217;t feel healthy. And I was much more tired than the normal getting up at 5:30 a.m. not getting home until 7-7:30, being a busy kind of person tired.  
And my motto is, if you have the right tools and you want to lose weight you will lose weight. If you don&#8217;t want to lose weight you won&#8217;t. It really is that simple if you have the right information.  
And so far Day 1 and Day 2 have been going well for me.  
And my exercise routine kicked back into gear on Saturday with a trend like this: spin; yoga; body conditioning; yoga.
