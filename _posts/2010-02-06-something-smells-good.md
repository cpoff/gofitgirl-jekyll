I did my usual Saturday workout at the gym: 1 hour of spin; half an hour of abs; and half an hour of body conditioning.  
While pumping my dumbbells in the last half an hour of my workout I could smell something really good. In the area where my gym is there are some restaurants and bars, etc.  
I am not a huge beef eater. But there was some sort of steak thingie being cooked and it smelled so good. Awww, man. That was so cruel.  
I came home and had some coffee and whole wheat waffles with peanut butter. Not quite as tasty as a steak&#8211;though I am sure the steak would have disappointed.
