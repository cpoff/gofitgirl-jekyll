    My CamelBak water bottle keeps me hydrated. I make it a goal to drink at least three of these a day.

I meant to write this post on Monday. But this has been a crazy and exhausting week.  
OK, how are you non-Facebook Go Fit Girl&#8217;s Monthly Challenge participants doing?  
There are 21 people participating in the Facebook event.  
One participant let the group know that she recently took a CPR class and was told my the instructor that we all wake up dehydrated. So drinking a glass of water before your morning coffee is recommended.  
And without even trying I do that most mornings, especially on days that I ride into work where I slurp down 24 ounces of water (750 mL).  
Another participant signed up for yoga in the park. What a great idea! Unfortunately the Bay Area had crazy thunderstorms that day. So she wasn&#8217;t able to attend. But it was a great idea.  
This challenge is definitely encouraging people to monitor and increase their water intake. And make more trips to power their noses.  
I recently upgraded my [CamelBak water bottle](http://astore.amazon.com/gofigi-20/detail/B007OX9X9K) from a 16 ounce (500 mL) to 24 ounce (750mL) container. I find using the CamelBak increases my water intake. It is easy to drink out of with very few spill mishaps.  
Since my upgrade I drink so much more water. It seems to be a little less of a struggle. My goal is to drink three bottles a day, which is nine servings or 72 ounces. That&#8217;s more than 2 liters a day. For reference sake a gallon of water is 128 ounces. But I usually hit close to 100 ounces a day. (As I am typing this post I am finishing my 11th serving for a total of 88 ounces.)  
I am signed up for my first yoga workshop on Sunday called [Restorative Yoga & Renal Fatigue](http://namasteoakland.com/programs/workshops/adrenal-fatigue-and-restorative-yoga) with one of my yoga favorite teachers, Vickie.  This will be my first true yoga workshop. I have attended holiday workshops. But those are really just a longer yoga class with some reflecting.  
My next holiday workshop will be the Thanksgiving workshop with Vickie, which is a benefit to raise money for [Sruith Asher Colbert&#8217;s Seva Challenge 2012](https://www.facebook.com/SrutihAsherColbertSevaChallenge2012) for [Off the Mat and Into the World](http://www.offthematintotheworld.org/index.php), which uses the power of yoga to inspireconscious, sustainable activism and ignitegrassroots social change, according to the website.  
I plan to write more about the Seva Challenge at a later time. But I encourage my readers to read up and it and possibly donate now.  
Keep drinking that water and exploring your yoga options. And let me know how you are doing.
