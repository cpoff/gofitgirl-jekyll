**Guest Post: Lisa**  
Lisa shares an easy and healthy soup recipe. I had told Lisa that [my garden vegetable soup](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3261) was good and filling. But it has been getting a little old. So she shared another recipe with me. And now I am sharing it with you. I plan on making it this weekend. (I have no kitchen at the moment since we are in a hotel room in San Diego.)  
Note from Lisa: This recipe is really filling, but is probably not too terribly high in calories. The tomatoes are the most calorically dense things in the soup. (Also, I strongly recommend adding some sour cream or yogurt as a garnish &#8212; it gives the soup a really substantial feel).  
ZESTY TOMATO-THYME SOUP<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />The Description :<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />This is a chunky soup with a light, fresh taste.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /><span id="lw_1262105133_1" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">The Recipe</span>:<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />1. Coarsely chop **one medium onion** and **two cloves of garlic** in a food processor. Remove the mixture; set aside. Chop **two stalks of celery** and **1/4 cup (packed) of fresh parsley**. Remove and set aside.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />2. In a large saucepan, warm one tablespoon of **olive oil** on medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the onion and garlic and stir-fry until the mixture begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in **2 16-oz. cans of crushed tomatoes** and their juice, 1 1/2 cups of **<span id="lw_1262105133_2" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-color: #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">chicken broth</span>**, two tablespoons of **<span id="lw_1262105133_3" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">tomato paste</span>**, two tablespoons of **grated orange zest**, one teaspoon of dried **thyme**, 1/2 teaspoon of **<span id="lw_1262105133_4" style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;">black pepper</span>** and the celery and parsley.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />3. Bring to a boil; then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for at least 10 minutes.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />4. Serve hot, at room temperature or slightly chilled, but not cold. Offer with a dollop of sour cream on top.<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" /><br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />Microwave Version:<br style="line-height: 1.2em; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial;" />To save time, you could make this in the microwave. Here&#8217;s how: Combine the oil, chopped onion, garlic, celery, and parsley in a 3-Qt. microwave-safe casserole. Cover loosley and cook at 100% for 4 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and their juice, the chicken broth, tomato paste, orange zest, thyme and pepper. Cover and cook at 100% for 6 minutes, then at 50% for another 7 minutes.
