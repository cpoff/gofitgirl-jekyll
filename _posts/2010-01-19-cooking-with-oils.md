<p style="text-align: left;">
  Steadily increasing American obesity notwithstanding, consumption of food with fat in it is a necessity. That means use of fat in the culinary arts is a necessity. Fat does many things in cooking, most of them good.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Fat is a good word,&#8221; Chef Dan Fluharty said in one recent lecture at the <span id="lw_1263925160_0" style="BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none">California Culinary Academy</span>. &#8220;Fat transfers heat, makes flavor, adds moisture, adds texture and feel in the mouth, provides a semi-permeable barrier and serves as a lubricant.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  No question arises about the need for fat in good cooking, all good cooking, not just gourmet cooking or <span id="lw_1263925160_1">French cuisine</span>. At-home cooking needs fat, too.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We use fat in culinary school, but the quantities are limited and utilitarian, not only for flavor.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Limiting fat intake is of course a necessity. It&#8217;s not as difficult as it seems. Mostly, if Americans avoid or severely limit the amount of fast food, &#8220;junk&#8221; food and other food with processed sugar in it, they can remain healthy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Here&#8217;s a quick primer on use of fats in cooking:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  * Let <span id="lw_1263925160_2" style="BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">animal fats</span> speak for themselves. If there&#8217;s more than a quarter-inch strip of fat on a steak or a pork chop, trim it off. The skinless chicken breast is healthier and can be kept flavorful if cooked properly. <span id="lw_1263925160_3">Ground beef</span> is now sold with the fat percentage on the label; simply buy one with a lower percentage.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  * Butter is necessary in sauces and other cooking, but its intake can be limited, too. In cooking, use <span id="lw_1263925160_4" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">unsalted butter</span>. Something else to note: Chef Instructor Tony Marano told us in class one day that U.S. commercial butter is 20% fat, while European butter is 10% fat. Good to know.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  * Be selective in using <span id="lw_1263925160_5">vegetable oils</span> in cooking. The best oils for cooking are canola and grape-seed. Both have high smoke points and are relatively healthy. <span id="lw_1263925160_6">Extra virgin olive oil</span> should never be used for cooking; the heat changes its chemical composition. Read labels to avoid oils that include hydrogenation and say they have trans-fats in them. The trend is away from these ingredients, but some products, especially mass-produced breads and pastries and some other fat-inclusive food products, still contain them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  * Some fats are actually good for us, relatively speaking. <span id="lw_1263925160_7" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">Unsaturated fatty acids</span>, like the omega-3 nutrients, aren&#8217;t produced by the human body so must be consumed. <span id="lw_1263925160_8">Oily fish</span>, such as salmon, have omega-3, and some milk and eggs can be found that include omega-3, depending on what the animals that produced those products were fed. Again, read labels.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  * Be careful about claims that some foods burn fats in the body. While it&#8217;s true that some foods do this, the effects are very limited. For example, <span id="lw_1263925160_9" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">cayenne pepper</span> is known to burn fat, as are ginger, garlic and cinnamon. All should be part of a <span id="lw_1263925160_10">healthy diet</span>, but the amount of those we can consume is pretty limited.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  None of this is meant to justify unlimited or random consumption of <span id="lw_1263925160_11" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">fatty foods</span>. Yet, unless one is on a medically restricted diet because of a certain heart condition or other ailment, fat remains a naturally occurring and necessary part of nutrition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And that includes its use in the culinary arts and all cooking.
