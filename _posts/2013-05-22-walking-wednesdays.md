When the weather is nice in South San Francisco (and that can be iffy) there is a small but mighty group who walks together on Wednesdays.  
The regulars come and go and come and go and new people trickle in.  
I am not a huge walker and personally would rather not walk.  
But if it is with a group of people it makes me much more motivated. (And with our wellness program you can earn points, which eventually earns you prizes.)  
I can&#8217;t walk every Wednesday as on alternate Wednesdays I have [Toastmasters](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10539). But when I can I join.  
There are so many great reasons to be part of this group: meet new people; meet up with co-workers/friends you don&#8217;t see as often; get away from your desk (I rarely take a lunch break and usually eat at my desk while working); fresh air; and, of course, exercise.  
According to [this Mayo Clinic article](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/walking/HQ01612), walking helps you maintain a healthy weight; prevent or manage various conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes; strengthen your bones; lifts your mood; and improves your balance and coordination.  
The Mayo Clinic article has some great tips. I recommend you read it.  
According to [this Livestrong article](http://www.livestrong.com/article/388326-is-walking-good-exercise/), a regular walking routine lowers your blood pressure, prevents cardiovascular disease and helps you maintain weight loss after dieting.  
And just about anyone can walk. You don&#8217;t need fancy equipment. Just the outdoors or a treadmill.  
Good shoes are a good idea. And it is really best to get fitted for the right kind of shoes. In the end it is worth it. I just recently got fitted for a new pair of [Asics](http://www.asicsamerica.com/Shop/Footwear/Running/Mens/GEL-Cumulus®-14-/p/0010124897.7501?shoeWidthCode=standard). Probably the last three or four pairs of shoes I have had have been Asics.  
And a good pair of socks make a world of difference. My absolute favorite socks right now by [Balega](http://www.balega.com/socks/hidden-dry). But I am also a fan of those made by [Wigwam](http://www.wigwam.com/Products/ProductList.aspx?Filters=1_A%7c2_W%7c3_U%7c).  
Get out there and start walking &#8230;
