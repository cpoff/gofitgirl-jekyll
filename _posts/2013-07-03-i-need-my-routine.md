The lack of posts have to do with many things going on in my life. Nothing major. Don&#8217;t freak out. It&#8217;s just life.  
Today I am going to talk about the [BART strike](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Gridlock-anger-during-3rd-day-of-strike-4644682.php), which is drastically affecting my life even though I don&#8217;t actually take BART to work.  
(For those of you who don&#8217;t know, BART stands for Bay Area Rapid Transit and is our commuter subway system in the Bay Area.)  
According to a story I read the other day, about 400,000 people utilize BART on a workday.  
I am happy to read that there is progress in negotiations.  
Now I will admit I am not fully aware of all the goings on. I know the contract was up at midnight on Sunday and BART workers wanted certain things and now there is a labor dispute. I am prounion for the most part. But I have my limits.  
Since BART workers went on strike my world has gone nuts-O!  
Curt and I only have one car. I drive to a shuttle and the shuttle drives me to work. Curt takes BART to work.  
So we have been tag teaming. I drive him to the ferry station in Oakland. Then I haul ass to where the work shuttle picks me up. Talk about anxiety as this week has been super busy at work and there is so much more traffic. The we do the opposite to come home.  
This means I am getting up at least an hour earlier (I normally get up at 5:30 a.m.). Yesterday morning I woke up at 3:30 and couldn&#8217;t go back to sleep. While I was sleeping it was poor sleep.  
I am also not exercising. By the time I get home my regular classes have started or are all over. And trying to exercise on my own right now is really posing a challenge.  
And you can imagine my food intake and alcohol intake is not so great either. Ho-Hum!  
Shuttles and taxis are being utilized this week to get to the airport since BART is usually the way we go.  
I anticipate Monday will be back to normal with our commutes, my food and alcohol intake and my exercise routine.  
When I am out of my routine I realize how important it is to me to maintain it. I hate feeling out of control and disjointed.
