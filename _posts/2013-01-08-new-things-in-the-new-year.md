The nutrition and exercise challenges for [Go Fit Girl!&#8217;s January Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10083) are about trying something new. ([Facebook event page here](https://www.facebook.com/events/226207667513965/).)  
In the past week I have tried a few things in yoga I wasn&#8217;t willing to dare before.  
I have been trying out the [Shake Weight](https://www.shakeweight.com). Yup, go ahead and laugh. I was able to snatch it from a co-worker who got it during our White Elephant work lunch. And I am trying it out for a future review for Go Fit Girl!&#8217;s Review Wednesday.  
Sunday morning is my regular grocery store weekly shopping. On Sunday I bought ingredients for [Weight Watchers Fresh Vegetable Soup](http://www.weightwatchers.com/food/rcp/RecipePage.aspx?recipeId=99961). Everything that went into the recipe I have eaten before. Last year I did a green smoothie cleanse and tried many vegetables (especially green leafy ones), which I had never tried before.  
After I picked up the produce I needed I wandered around looking for a new item to cook. I looked at [endives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endive), which looked like a weird yellowish cabbage or lettuce. Eh, maybe not.  
Then I decided to go look at the squash. I grabbed an acorn squash. I think I have probably eaten acorn squash, but maybe not. But I definitely have never cooked it before. So I will be looking for a recipe later this week to try it out.  
When I got home from the grocery Sunday morning I had time to chop and cook the Fresh Vegetable Soup before yoga. It made a huge pot.  
My first bowl of it was for a late lunch Sunday afternoon. Because I am so into protein I decided to add some tofu to my serving bowl of soup. The next time I make the soup I may add a meat protein.  
Later in the week I plan to take all the extra ingredients for the soup and make a stir fry with brown rice. So that is kinda new as well. I do eat stir fry and I have a frozen one I buy from Safeway. But I have never made one completely on my own.  
What new things have you tried?
