Go Fit Girl! is getting high-tech. And really, it is all owed to my well-paid (ha ha!) IT/webmaster &#8220;online boy.&#8221;  
Curt got Go Fit Girl! a new hosting service, a new look and we are getting fancy. You can now comment on the blog using your sign on for Facebook, Twitter, etc. Pretty awesome.  
Take a look around, comment. Let me know what you think: what you like, don&#8217;t like, etc. If you are having issues commenting please let me know via e-mail ann@gofitgirl.com or even via Facebook.  
We are still tinkering with it. It will eventually be where we want it to be.  
I know I haven&#8217;t been blogging as much lately. But don&#8217;t fear. I have lots of ideas brewing in my head and lots of things I want to write about, research and explore. So keep coming back.  
\***\***  
In the transition of moving the blog from one hosting service to another two of my posts dropped off. Bummer.  
Because they were genius (ha! yea, right) I thought I would summarize them here for you.  
The first post was about how I went 47 days without eating candy. My co-worker Jessica gave up candy for Lent. As I non-practicing Catholic I don&#8217;t observe Lent. But I thought I would join her in the challenge.  
We were both successful in not eating candy for the time we set as a goal.  
The second post was about the stairs at work and how I rarely take them. Though many of my co-workers seem jazzed about the stairs. I am not. I usually wear heels at work so taking the stairs can be dangerous. And since I exercise 6-7 times a week I don&#8217;t feel the need to take the stairs.
