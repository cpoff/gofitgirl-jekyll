Curt and I are staying at our third and final hotel of Holiday 2012 trip.  
At home we don&#8217;t normally wash our towels and sheets every single day. And we don&#8217;t expect it to be done every day at a hotel. Frankly, I don&#8217;t need them to clean my room every day.  
I don&#8217;t make my bed every day. I know, it&#8217;s crazy. My mom made me make my bed every day, which to me makes no sense. If we are having company over I will make my bed but that&#8217;s about it. I mean, what&#8217;s the point?  
Anyway, I am gonna guess that most people don&#8217;t wash their towels and sheets every day. And if you do, why?  
Think about the water, detergent and energy used for that.  
This is a super easy way to be environmentally friendly.  
[This article gives you all sort of ideas](http://www.ehow.com/info_8240941_methods-water-saving-laundry.html) on how to conserve water. They all seem logical to me &#8230;  
[According to this article](http://www.ecoevaluator.com/building/water-efficiency/wasted-water.html), if every household in the United States used low-flow fixtures, in just one year, we could save 2 trillion gallons of water and 4 billion dollars.  
Now that sounds great. But can everyone afford to replace low-flow fixtures for their faucets, washing machines, shower heads and toilets? When the low-flow toilet came out there was a lot of complaining about the lack of flushing involved to get even simple items to go down the toilet.  
And back to doing laundry, are we overusing soap as well? I remember watching a movie where the mom reminded her college son that the line on the cup for the detergent should be ignored and really, use less.  
[According to this New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/your-money/13shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), “Most people use 10 to 15 times the amount of soap they need, and they’re pouring money down the drain,” said Vernon Schmidt, who has been a repairman for almost 35 years and is the author of a self-published book, “Appliance Handbook for Women: Simple Enough Even a Man Can Understand.”
