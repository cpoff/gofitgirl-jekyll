I was feeling a little off yesterday. And a little off today. I decided it was best that I didn&#8217;t go to the noon spin class.  
Exercising keeps me healthy. But if I am not feeling well or am definitely sick I know to let my body rest. The body needs to heal. Pushing yourself is a bad idea.  
So later in the day I started to feel better. But taking a day off from the gym was probably a good thing.
