I am already injured. I think I am too old for this exercise stuff.  
Anyway, my left knee was bothering me a bit while walking/running yesterday. (But the other day my foot was bothering me and I kept on trucking and it was fine later on.)  
After my workout last night my knee was hurtin&#8217; a little. Well, when I woke up this morning it was stiff. It is feeling better now&#8211;still bothering me a bit. So no gym workout today. But I will do some walking and stretching this weekend.
