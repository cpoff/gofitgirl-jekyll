My mom comes into town tomorrow night. Curt is heading to Missouri for a high school reunion. So I invited my mom out here for a girls&#8217; weekend.  
I haven&#8217;t decided yet whether the time she is here I will be counting points and tracking my food.  
I am gonna just go with the flow.  
But seriously, with all the booze I bought in anticipation of my mom&#8217;s visit &#8230;  
If I decide to not track and indulge I will. And I won&#8217;t feel guilty.  
I can give myself permission to &#8220;slack off&#8221; because I know on Monday I will be back on plan.  
This long weekend will be full of shopping, mani/pedis, brunches, lunches, lounging on the couch watching Lifetime and SVU, chatting, a yoga class or two, dinners, drinks, movies.  
I can&#8217;t wait to hang out with my mom, my friend.  
It&#8217;s OK to splurge once in a while. But it just can&#8217;t be done all the time. Picking and choosing events or times will help you keep things under control.  
Next month Curt and I are heading to Mexico City. When I am on vacation I am not on plan. A big part of travel for me is enjoying the food and drinks. Once we are back from vacation I will get back to my healthy routine of eating better and exercising.
