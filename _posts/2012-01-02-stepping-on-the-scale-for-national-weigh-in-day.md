    I participated in National Weigh In Day today. I didn't let the number on the scale discourage me. I now have a goal to work toward.

The other day I saw a commercial announcing that today was [National Weigh In Day](http://www.news-medical.net/news/20120102/January-2nd-marked-as-National-Weigh-In-Day.aspx), which is sponsored by [Special K](http://www.specialk.com/).  
In the commercial women were jumping on the scale and the results were things like pizazz, confidence, etc. The campaign asked: What will you gain when you lose?  
I like the idea of a positive campaign when jumping on the scale and maybe seeing a number one is not super jazzed to see.  
I jumped on the scale today.  
It had been months since I had stepped on the scale. I didn&#8217;t want to know the number so I avoided a scale.  
But  in order for me to get back to being healthy and cutting out calories (and a goal is to eat less sugar) I knew I needed to know what I needed to work on and see my actual weight.  
I lost 30 pounds before. I know how to lose weight and I know how to maintain. And I don&#8217;t have 30 pounds to lose this time around.  
I am still sick so this week I am just writing down my food&#8211;just to see what I am eating. But my goal is to eat healthier and try to eliminate candy and most crap this week.  
If I am back to my regular health next week I will actually track my food (Points and calories) and keep a tally for myself.  
If you missed National Weigh In Day I don&#8217;t see why you can&#8217;t weigh in Tuesday, Wednesday or later this week.  
I don&#8217;t really believe in New Year&#8217;s Resolutions&#8211;mostly because they don&#8217;t work. But think about committing to something to make yourself healthier. It can be small to start. Small goals are better than unrealistic huge ones.  
Maybe drink one soda a day instead of three; or buy a bunch of fruit and veggies and snacks on those instead of chips and candy; if you smoke, commit to reducing your nicotine intake or try to quit (smoking is so dangerous and gross!); if you drink, maybe eliminate a few drinks a week or just have a few drinks on the weekends (which is my plan); drink more water; go walking a couple of days a week; try yoga or spin. (If you try spin make sure someone teaches you how to set up your bike correctly. And with yoga, don&#8217;t compete with anyone in the class, including yourself.)  
The ideas are endless. Good luck to you. And let me know what is working for your or not.
