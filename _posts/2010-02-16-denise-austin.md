ad was on my blog.  
Hee hee. I just thought that was funny and wanted to share:  
[<img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3404" title="DA_ad" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DA_ad1-150x150.gif" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DA_ad1.gif)  
I don&#8217;t like all the ads that appear on my blog, such as the cookie diet. But there isn&#8217;t anything I can do about it. Anyway, I guess Denise Austin ads are OK.
