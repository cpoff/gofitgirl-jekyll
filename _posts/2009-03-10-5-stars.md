Last week I worked out 5 times. That is pretty good for getting back on track. Three days of yoga, one body conditioning and one kickboxing.  
My kickboxing class time is moving to 7 p.m. So I may bail on it. Two main reasons: I would have to stay about work until about 6:40 p.m. and I am not that into the class since we got a new teacher.  
There is a spin class on Thursdays at 6 p.m., which I may end up taking. I will keep you all updated.
