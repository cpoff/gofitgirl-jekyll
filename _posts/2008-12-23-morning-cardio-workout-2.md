I went to the gym this morning before work. I had a meeting at the time of my yoga class. So I made sure I still got in a workout. When the alarm went off at 6:10 I thought there was no way I was getting out of bed. And I didn&#8217;t initially. Hit the snooze once. I was having a weird dream&#8211;so that got me to get up when the alarm went off a second time.  
I did the elliptical for 45 minutes plus a 5 minute cool down.  
The only bummer about doing cardio in the morning is that I have to drag all of my crap to the gym to shower and get ready. Luckily all of my toiletries are in my travel bag. So I just grab that. But I always need an extra bag besides just my gym bag and honker purse.  
And I am getting out of work early tomorrow&#8211;noon. So I am planning on hitting the gym after work before coming home and having Christmas Eve festivities with Curt. We have taken some of our families traditions and incorporated our own.
