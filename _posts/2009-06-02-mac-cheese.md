Tonight for dinner I made the [Mac & Cheese recipe](http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/shows/cook-yourself-thin/recipes/mac-and-cheese-0) from Cook Yourself Thin.  
It wasn&#8217;t your typical Mac & Cheese. Man, it was good and rich and filling. I couldn&#8217;t finish what I had served myself&#8211;well, I could have. But I didn&#8217;t want to feel gross!  
It took longer to make than I normally like to take to cook. I don&#8217;t really cook and I pretty much hate it. It was a long day at work&#8211;like 10 hour long day&#8211;but I still wanted to make the Mac & Cheese, which was easy to make just took longer than nuking soup. ðŸ™‚
