    Dinner and drink tonight.

Tonight I earned my beer. Yes, I had a beer tonight. I know, I am such a rule breaker.  
I hit Thursday night spin class at the gym. I was a little late because of bad traffic.  
I hosted a meeting today where we had pizza. (Bribery to get people to show up.) I had two slices. So I definitely needed to do some exercise. Since I had a second late lunch I wasn&#8217;t super hungry when I got home tonight. But I still needed a little something.  
So I made a Spicy Black Bean Burger. So good! And my fake mashed potatoes, which are squished up cauliflower, which I season with Frank&#8217;s Red Hot sauce, salt and pepper.  
I feel lucky that I like so many vegetables. Most are low calorie, filling and really healthy.
