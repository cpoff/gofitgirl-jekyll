    After many years of practicing yoga and working on breathing exercises I learned how to breathe into my back last year.

Yoga class was a treat this morning. Even more than normal.  
I took a friend with me.  
Our friends Stefanie and Aaron are in town along with their teenage son and 4-year-old son. They are on their way to Disneyland. But stopped in the Bay Area for a couple of days.  
Anyway, Stefanie and I went to the 9 a.m. Hatha yoga class with Vickie. Normally I take the 10:45 Vinyasa class with Ashley. But on occasion I take Vickie&#8217;s Sunday class.  
It was nice to take a friend along with me. And Vickie thought we were related.  
Today we focused on [breathing, especially in our diaphragm](http://www.cchs.net/health/health-info/docs/2400/2409.asp?index=9445). We focused on opening our sides and breathing through the muscles in our ribs, our [intercostal muscles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercostal_muscle). The breathing exercises we worked on helped us open up our kidneys as well.  
I love when I learn something new about my body in yoga class.  
Over the years of practicing yoga I have learned many breathing techniques. I learn how to breathe when I am nervous or stressed or scared. And it really helps calm me.  
Vickie makes us work hard. But we are always rewarded. She likes to throw in a full or partial Restorative pose Â or two or three in there as well. We used the [bolster](http://www.theyogawarehouse.com/prodimages/Bolsters/Round%20Bolster%20kapok.JPG) a lot today, which I like.  
One of the most interesting things we used the [bolster for was Pigeon pose](http://www.myyogaonline.com/about-yoga/learn-about-yoga/pigeon-pose-ways-to-prop-up-your-yoga-practice), which is my favorite hip opener. [Pigeon](http://www.yogajournal.com/media/originals/2845-32.jpg) is an intense pose. I felt even more intensity with the bolster.  
When class was over Stefanie said it was just wanted she needed. I am glad I could share that experience with her.
