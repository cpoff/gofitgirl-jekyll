Last week I had eaten Honey Nut Cheerios dry. On Friday I wanted them with milk. I wanted cereal so much. I decided to have them with milk. Ugh, bad idea. Soon after my congestion increased for the rest of the day.  
Today I wanted Raisin Bran. So I bought soy milk at the grocery. It wasn&#8217;t quite the same. But at least I could have some cereal without my congestion increasing.  
Today was seriously a day of rest. I napped on and off all day. And I am still tired. I will be happy when I finally kick this cold.
