    Many of us sported our Team Goldman bowling shirts from an offsite last year.

This morning I participated in a charity walk with friends/former and current co-workers to raise money for the [Pancreatic Cancer Action Network](http://purplestride.kintera.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=1089448&lis=1&kntae1089448=E68B18DBB23C4E738AC23FF7AB5F7B18).  
We came together this morning to honor a great man who left this world too soon.  
Team Goldman ended up being No. 4 in fundraising.  
We rallied at the end to get back to No. 3, where we had been during most of the fundraising months before the run/walk.  
My team raised $6,244. I raised $1,393, which made me the No. 2 fundraiser on Team Goldman.  
The only terrible thing today was that the walk started at 7:45 in San Francisco.  
But the great part was I got a walk in, raised money for a great cause and got to have a reunion and hang out with fun people who I currently work with and some who no longer work there.  
Oh, and there was a brunch cookout after, which included mimosas. So not too shabby.  
Thank you to everyone who donated. You will be getting a thank-you note soon.
