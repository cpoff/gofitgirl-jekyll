I have to pat myself on the back for getting up early to go to yoga before work this morning. For some reason I was wide awake about 30 mins. before I had to get up. 5:45 and I am awake. WTH!!?? So right about now I am ready for a nap. Good thing I have my free Starbucks coffee from work.  
I also went to kickboxing last night&#8211;my third time. I am feeling less and less stupid.  
This week I have been a little slacking in the working out. But I am getting back on track.
