    My good ol' heating pad has gotten me through many a pain for many years. Ibuprofen and Aleve have helped me, too.

Last night and most of today I have been doing what I call the &#8220;[old lady walk](http://valanne.typepad.com/.a/6a013486d00cf4970c0147e1e31eae970b-800wi).&#8221;  
On Thursday night I worked out with Jenn and Monica. I am pretty much sore all over. But my thighs and butt are what are really feeling it.  
I knew after the hour-long program we did I would be feeling it later on. All day yesterday I could feel it deep in my muscles. I went to yoga last night and it was difficult.  
Before I went to bed last night I was doing the &#8220;old lady walk.&#8221;  
I did a little more than 10 minutes of stair climbing today before spin as part of a work wellness challenge. Spin was tougher than normal with the sore butt, thighs and abs. Then my usual 30 minutes of abs. I was gonna skip out on body conditioning as I didn&#8217;t think I could handle weights or squats or lunges. I did the class. But wow, that hurt.  
I have been switching back and forth between ibuprofen and Aleve. I have also been using my heating pad, which I normally use for my back pain and cramps.  
In this [WebMD article](http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/art-sore-muscles-joint-pain), it mentions ice is better to start with: Ice the sore area right after the activity to reduce inflammation, then use heat later to increase blood flow to the area.  
Like a hangover, time will cure the pain. The muscle soreness &#8220;peaks within about 48 hours and then it will gradually get better,&#8221; Ethel Frese, PT, DPT, CCS, associate professor of Physical Therapy at St. Louis University, says in the WebMD article.  
I found conflicting information online as to whether you should rest your sore muscles or work through the soreness. This [slideshow on Livestrong.com](http://www.livestrong.com/slideshow/551692-how-to-get-rid-of-sore-muscles-after-a-workout/#slide-1) gives some good tips.  
The sore muscles I have are good sore muscles. Just make sure when doing weights or squats or lunges or abs that you don&#8217;t actually hurt yourself. That&#8217;s a whole other issue.
