While in Massachusetts I walked, a lot.  
Curt stayed in Wellesley for his training at the [Babson College Conference Center](http://execed.babson.edu/becc/accomodations.aspx). Apparently they had a nice fitness center, which I never visited.  
But while in Boston we walked a lot. We had a car&#8211;but just left it in the garage. We did a decent amount of walking while in Cambridge yesterday, too.  
I won&#8217;t talk about my eating and drinking habits &#8230; but hey, at least I walked a lot.
