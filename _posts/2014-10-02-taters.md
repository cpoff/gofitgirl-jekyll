Since my recent &#8220;FUNemployment&#8221; began I have been trying to cook more. It&#8217;s not something I enjoy. But really to ensure I eat healthy (and not spend a ton of money) I need to cook at home often.  
Because I have more time to plan meals, look up healthy recipes online, shop and execute the deliciously healthy nutritious meals cooking is much more tolerable.  
A lot of my meal research comes from [Hungry Girl](http://www.hungry-girl.com). The website description says: healthy recipes, low-calories foods, weight-loss advice, diet tips &#8216;n&#8217; tricks.  
I have been a fan of Hungry Girl for years. I have a few of her cookbooks. I even went to one of her book signings.  
Hungry Girl comes up with recipes we know and love and finds healthier and/or lower calorie versions of so many dishes.

My goal is to feature a recipe every week (or so) on the new [Recipes tab](http://gofitgirl.com/recipes/) here on GFG!  
Last week one night for dinner I made ahi tuna steaks. I asked Curt what he wanted with the tuna. He requested a starch. (Don&#8217;t worry, we also had green beens.)  
My research on the World Wide Web told me that mashed potatoes were a good starch with tuna.  
For myself I made [Hungry Girl&#8217;s miracle mashies](http://www.hungry-girl.com/newsletters/raw/919-low-calorie-corn-muffin-mashed-potato-and-vegetarian-tamale-pie-recipes). For Curt I used the same recipe minus the cauliflower.  
(When looking up the recipe on the link above scroll down passed the cheesy-good cornbread muffins, which now I have to make. Yum! AND, I am also gonna try that HG&#8217;s hot tamale pie.)  
If you are trying to get more vegetables in your diet or someone else&#8217;s this is a great way to sneak it in. The cauliflower is almost undetectable.
