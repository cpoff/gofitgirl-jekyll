So I know I did well last week with the caloric intake and the exercise.  
But I am skeptical that I actually lost 7 pounds in one week. But according to the doctor-like scale at the gym I am minus Â 7 pounds from a week ago.  
Maybe I was bloated last week or retaining water. Maybe I was dehydrated today&#8211;but that is seriously unlikely since I suck down water like it is going out of style.  
Not that I am not excited for the weight loss. I am. I just am not sure it was really 7 pounds. We will see what weigh-in says next Monday.
