My intention today was to get up this morning and head to the gym. I woke up about 7:15, which is rather late for me. (The gym didn&#8217;t open until 8 a.m. today.) Â I still felt tired and went into the spare room and turned on the TV to Lifetime Movie Network. At some point I dozed off for a bit. I toyed with idea of still going to the gym or working out from home. Eventually neither sounded great and laziness won the battle.  
Today is the kind of day where I wish I was a runner. It would be so easy to throw on some exercise clothes, grab my iPhone and take off running. But I hate to run and I pretty much suck at running. I think I would last about 2 minutes before I needed to take a break. I know a lot of people who run and tell me if I can do crazy spin I can run. Well, not true. Running would be great because it is easy cardio you can do anywhere.

I was successful at getting the stank out of my yoga mat. I decided to throw it in the washer with very little detergent (as instructed) on a delicate cycle. Once it was done in the washer, I pulled it out and grabbed a hanger with clips for a skirt or pants and hung it in the shower to dry.  
By this morning the mat was clean, dry and the stank was gone. Little did I know that would be so easy and successful.  
The one site I found where it said to not wash your mat in a washing machine said the machine wash can wear on your mat. I could see that at some point.  
Eventually I want to buy a new mat. The one I have is kinda cheap and I may want to invest in a better one at some point.
