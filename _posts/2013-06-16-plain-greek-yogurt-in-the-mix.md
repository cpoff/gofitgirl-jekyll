One of the challenges for [Go Fit Girl&#8217;s June Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10677) is to experiment with plain Greek yogurt in various meals.  
Before this challenge started I had already been experimenting with the Greek yogurt, which is why I thought it would be fun to make it part of the nutrition challenge this month.  
Here&#8217;s what I have tried:

  * I substituted sour cream with plain Greek yogurt on my baked potatoes. Great substitute.
  * I used the plain Greek yogurt to make a cream sauce for my penne pasta and saut√©ed tomatoes. It looked gross but it tasted amazing.
  * I used 1/2 a cup to a cup and drizzled about a tablespoon of honey over the yogurt. It&#8217;s a yummy snack and/or dessert.
  * I experimented with a Morningstar &#8220;Chicken&#8221; Patty on a toasted hot dog bun, which had a dollop of plain Greek yogurt and some hot sauce. Eh, it was just OK. But it just tasted like I added the yogurt &#8230; with no added value to it.
  * I used the yogurt to make creamed spinach. It was rather tasty.

Fruit and granola are good things to mix in as well.  
I bought another vat of plain Greek yogurt at the grocery this morning. I hope to come up with a few other ideas. But I would love to hear what you have been trying or maybe something you have been doing already.  
What have you all been doing with the yogurt?
