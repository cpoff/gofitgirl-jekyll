So the gym was open today, but all classes were canceled.<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3295" title="spin" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/spin-225x300.jpg" alt="spin" width="225" height="300" />  
I arrived a little after 9 and decided to ride the bike instead of the elliptical. I put in my ear buds, cranked up the music and pretty much designed my own spin class.  
I climbed a lot of hills, did some endurance, sprints and more hills.  
My favorite work out song is Eye of the Tiger. It was a little hard to maintain a beat while I was on the bike. But I went for it. I did hill sprints to Like a Virgin.  
After about 30-40 minutes on the bike I did about 15 minutes of core and some free weights.  
Christmas Eve dinner is fairly healthy. Poff family tradition is to have shrimp on Christmas Eve. So Curt and I have carried on that tradition. We will also have biscuits and baked potatoes.  
My family tradition is designed around Mexican food&#8211;not so healthy. Curt and I will have tamales for breakfast Christmas morning. Then I am planning on making cheese enchiladas, rice and beans for dinner.  
Happy Holidays to all my readers!
