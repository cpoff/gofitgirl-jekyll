So since last Tuesday I have been counting my calories. I didn&#8217;t talk about it before on this blog because I feelÂ like when I do I do well for like two days and it is down hill from there.  
But I weighed myself this morning and I lost 2 pounds since last Tuesday. My fingers are fat, so I know I am retaining water. So the weight loss could be even more. But I am more than happy with a 2-pound weight loss in the past week.  
I can&#8217;t figure out why I am retaining water. I drank like 9 servings of water yesterday, had no booze (crazy, I know!), didn&#8217;t have soy sauce (that usually does it).  
I use the [Tap & Track app](http://www.macworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=79923&expand=false) on my iPhone to count my calories and track my weight.
