    These few simple items gave me helped me create a well-balanced exercise routine at home yesterday morning.Â

My routine was completely out of whack this week.  
I got sick on Sunday and even though I felt better on Monday I decided to skip the gym and make sure I was back to healthy. (Plus I had a fever on Sunday, which broke Sunday night or Monday morning, and didn&#8217;t want to infect anyone else.)  
Tuesday I hit my regular yoga class. Wednesday I had to stay at work later and planned to hit a later yoga class. But once I got home I was beat and had some work to do.  
Thursday and Friday I had a training in the city (San Francisco). It went until 5 on Thursday and I knew I would never make my 6 p.m. spin class. I decided to wear a camisole tank top under my blouse. I shoved my flip flops and yoga pants into my purse (yup, it pays to have a big purse). I went straight from the [BART](http://bart.gov) station to the yoga studio with about 5 minutes to spare and quickly changed into my yoga clothes for class.  
Last night Curt and I had a dinner to attend and I likely would not have made the evening yoga class anyway. I wanted to go to my regular 6:30 a.m. body conditioning class. But I just thought it would be cutting it too close.  
So instead I used the few items of exercise equipment I have and put a 40-45 minute routine together. I definitely could have gone an hour. But my time was limited as I had to shower and get ready and then head to the city for my training.  
I think with a few items anyone can put together a cardio and conditioning workout together. I incorporated all of the exercise part of [GFG!&#8217;s April Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10354).  
Here&#8217;s what I did:

  * 5-7 minutes of non-stop hula hooping
  * For one song (which happened to be Dog Days are Over) I attempted to jump rope. I did it in the kitchen and that didn&#8217;t work out so well. But I didn&#8217;t want an audience and avoided going outside.
  * 100 jumping jacks
  * Shoulder press first right side then left&#8211;15 on each side (My dumbbells are only 3 pounds. So I doubled up to create more weight, which I need as I have built up to a weight that works for me.)
  * 50 jumping jacks
  * Shoulder press first right side then left&#8211;15 on each side
  * 50 jumping jacks
  * 15 bicep curls with resistance band
  * 15 tricep backs with resistance band
  * 15 bicep curls with resistance band
  * 15 tricep backs with resistance band
  * With resistance band walk side to side (two steps to the left and two steps to the right) 20 times
  * Stand still on one leg with resistance band and kick out other leg to the side with resistance 15 times each leg
  * 20 squats with resistance band. (In order to maximize the resistance I had to pull the band high above my head, which ended up working my shoulders and triceps.)
  * Rows with Figure 8 band 15 each side&#8211;two times
  * Squat and move into shoulder lift with dumbbells 15 times each side&#8211;two times
  * And to finish off, a 1:30 plank (we are having a plank challenge at work&#8211;working up to a 4-minute plank&#8211;eeekkk!)

With a few small and inexpensive pieces of equipment a thorough exercise routine can easily be done at home. I will likely invest in some heavier dumbbells. I don&#8217;t have a lot of space for equipment so the items I have are what I have. All of my items, except for the hula hoop (and yoga mat), fit into a crate.  
And what I realized is that when I travel I can take my jump rope, resistance band and Figure 8 band, which all easily fit in my suitcase, and create a full exercise routine.
