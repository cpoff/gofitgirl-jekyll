I am excited to announce that tomorrow, July 30, my dad&#8217;s wife, Hilda, will have her Grand Opening of [Mindful Yoga studio](http://www.mindfulyogatucson.com).  
Hilda is a registered yoga teacher and has taught in Tucson and San Francisco. According to the website, her practice is one of mindfulness with emphasis on the breath and honoring the body, spirit and mind on and off the yoga mat.  
The studio has a wide range of [yoga instructors](http://www.mindfulyogatucson.com/teachers.html) and a full and versatile [class schedule](http://www.mindfulyogatucson.com/schedule.html).  
Unfortunately for me, I won&#8217;t be able to check out the studio or take any classes until the end of September when I am in town for my high school reunion. Fortunately for me that is only about two months away.  
The studio is located at the El Dorado Village Shopping Center next to the Trader Joe&#8217;s. The address is [1101 N. Wimot Road](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1101+North+Wilmot+Road,+Tucson,+AZ&aq=1&oq=1101+n.+wilmot+tuc&sll=37.269174,-119.306607&sspn=8.861006,19.138184&vpsrc=0&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1101+N+Wilmot+Rd,+Tucson,+Arizona+85712&ll=32.237053,-110.858724&spn=0.009202,0.01869&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A), Suite 123, Tucson.  
Make sure to check out and &#8220;Like&#8221; the [Mindful Yoga studio Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MindfulYogaTucson).  
I know that Hilda has worked hard to make her dream come true. And she wants to share it with all of us.  
So please check out the new studio. The prices are great and the range of classes is pretty amazing, too. Let me know that you went and what you think of the studio, the classes and the instructors.  
And if you go, make sure to tell them Go Fit Girl! sent you.
