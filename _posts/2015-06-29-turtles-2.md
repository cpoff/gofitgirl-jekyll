My first two weeks at Turtles have been great.  
My very first class (on June 15) was a Monday night Gentle Yoga class. And I had 13 students. (The max is 15.) My students seemed receptive. And I heard from the front desk that I got lots of great feedback.  
My first Thursday night class was a little smaller. Some of my Monday night students came to my Thursday night class.  
I also added a third class to my Turtles schedule: Saturday mornings at 10:15. It&#8217;s Yoga Align to Restorative. I am so happy to be taking a little more Restorative Yoga teaching on. I love practicing Restorative Yoga and sharing it with my students.  
In Week 2 I am already starting to have regulars, which I really love. I want to get to know my students and make their yoga experience the best that I can.  
And I am having some amazing connections with students.  
I worked a front desk shift the past two Friday afternoons/evenings. I am learning a few things along the way. And I am able to help out with signing students in, getting their info into the system, etc.  
And today is the start of Week 3.  
My [full Turtles schedule](http://www.turtlesyoga.com/class-descriptions/yoga-pilates-zumba-schedule/) is:

  * **Mondays** Gentle Yoga 5:45-7 p.m.
  * **Thursdays** Hatha Alignment 7-8:30 p.m.
  * **Saturdays** Yoga Align to Restorative 10:15-11:30 a.m.

You can find my Turtles schedule and [my full class schedule here](http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/).  
Did you know that Turtles are known to have a connection with our ancestors? They are known to be wise, hard working and all about going with the flow &#8220;being in present time.&#8221; At Turtles, we strive to follow the wisdom of the Turtle.  
You are always welcome to come to Turtles for a tour. It&#8217;s a beautiful space. I am really happy and grateful to be part of the Turtles family.
