<a href="http://gofitgirl.com/2018/04/taking-care-of-no-1-2/heart-for-post/" rel="attachment wp-att-16009"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-16009" src="http://gofitgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/heart-for-post-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I recently made the decision to drastically reduce my teaching schedule.  
Many of you know that and some of you don&#8217;t know.  
This was a difficult decision to make and I didn&#8217;t take it lightly or make this decision without a lot of thought and love put into it.  
As a yoga teacher I teach and preach self-love, self-care, self-discipline. I remind my students that they need to take care of No. 1 before they take care of anyone else.  
I have not been taking care of No. 1, which means I can&#8217;t be the best yoga teacher (and cycling instructor) I can possibly be. I can&#8217;t be the best wife or daughter or friend or sister or cousin &#8230; either.  
I feel tired, exhausted, overwhelmed, burned out &#8230;  
I am opening myself up for some healing and new opportunities to arise. And some have already come to me. Some of the opportunities I am working on, some are set and some are what the future holds.  
It&#8217;s amazing when you let go something else, another opportunity (or even opportunities) comes along.  
Some of my students have been concerned that I am no longer teaching yoga. That is not the case. My current schedule has me teaching four classes regularly (two public and two private). I will be doing a lot of subbing in April. And in May I am adding two public classes to my Thursday night schedule in my friend Sandi&#8217;s beautiful Yoga Yurt. More information below.  
My schedule has more openings for private sessions and classes, office yoga, yoga parties, workshops, weekend retreats, wine and yoga events, etc. You can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:ann@gofitgirl.com" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:ann@gofitgirl.com">ann@gofitgirl.com</a> to inquire about dates and pricing.

If you are having difficulty booking your class or have any questions, you can e-mail me at <ann@gofitgirl.com>.  
I&#8217;ve decided that I have to plan for right now. We all have a lot of uncertainty, myself included. And I don&#8217;t know what the future holds. But I can be as present as I can be right now for this moment in my life while taking care of myself with love, kindness and compassion.
