    I practiced yoga over the weekend in our hotel room with my mat and eye pillow. There was an odd pillow on our bed, which worked as a bolster for me while in Savasana.

Curt and I stayed in Santa Cruz over the weekend.  
I didn&#8217;t check to see if the hotel had a gym. I am about 50/50 on that. Sometimes I am a rockstar with the hotel gym. And other times my exercise clothes never even leave the suitcase.  
This time around I brought my yoga mat with me. And not my travel mat. I brought the full real deal. We drove, which meant I could pretty much bring whatever I wanted.  
I practiced yoga yesterday and today in the hotel.  
I have struggled in the past to practice what I call hotel yoga. I believe it was easier this time around as I have had a home practice for about six weeks.  
My practice over the weekend had to be one I could do without props and not super active because The Husband was snoozing while I practiced.  
Some time last year I had written up a short Yin Yoga practice to try out with a friend.  
I don&#8217;t have a ton of experience with a Yin practice. You hold the poses longer. [According to the Yin Yoga website](http://www.yinyoga.com/ys1_0.0_what_is_yin.php), Yin Yoga targets the connective tissues, such as the ligaments, bones, and even the joints of the body that normally are not exercised very much in a more active style of asana practice. … Yin Yoga generally targets the connective tissues of the hips, pelvis and lower spine.  
I did a lot of hip openers and man, could I feel it later.  
A few of the poses I practiced were (half) [Happy Baby](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2497), [Reclining Twist,](http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/1382) [Bananasana](http://gofitgirl.com/2012/11/home-practice-while-in-missouri/banana/), [Baddha Konasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/486). The Yin Yoga site has a list of many [Yin Yoga asanas](http://www.yinyoga.com/ys2_2.0_yinyoga_asanas.php), which includes pictures and some have videos.  
When holding Yin poses I like to set a timer so that I am not wondering how long I have been in a pose and that both sides are held for an even amount of time. Because The Husband was snoozing less than 10 feet away I decided to not use a timer and go by the count of my breaths. I held all Yin poses for 30 breaths (inhale exhale counts as one).  
The breath practice was a great idea as it kept me in the present, which is a goal and struggle when practicing, especially when in uncomfortable and intense poses.  
And an added benefit to practicing in a hotel room on the beach is hearing the waves crash in the background.
