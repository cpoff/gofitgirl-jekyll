Yesterday I did my regular two hours at the gym. In the body conditioning class Jennifer had us do our weights, squats and lunges much more slowly than usual. It so made a difference. I also went a little heavier with my weights (10 lbs. for biceps and shoulders and [usually it is 8] and 8 lbs. for triceps [usually 5]).  
I definitely felt a little sore last night. Today &#8230; ouch! Biceps, butt and thighs are sore today.  
I was lazy and skipped yoga today, but I don&#8217;t know if I could have handled an hour and a half intense yoga class with sore muscles.  
Oh, and in case you were wondering &#8230; I haven&#8217;t touched one piece of candy in my bowl. Oh yea!
