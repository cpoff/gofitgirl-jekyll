    I haven&#8217;t taken a bath in years. And today I soaked in some Epsom Salt to help sore muscles.

Recently I have been taking some hard core body conditioning classes.  
Sometimes I do a double-header and take Will&#8217;s Total Athletic Conditioning class Thursday night and his 6:30 a.m. Total Athletic Conditioning class Friday morning. Yes, I am nuts.  
The last time I did that my thighs were in pain for at least five days.  
A fellow double-header told me to try Epsom Salt. And Will agreed.  
Last night I had to hit Walgreens for a few things. So I decided to also get some Epsom Salt. I had debated whether to get the small carton or the large carton. I thought I might as well go for the big one. Glad I did.  
Today I soaked in the tub for 15-20 minutes in an Epsom Salt bath. (I don&#8217;t even remember the last time I took a bath. I mean, really, who has time?)  
I have to say I think it worked. I feel a little soreness but nothing too intense. And I don&#8217;t feel like I am gonna die just sitting down on the toilet. No [old lady walk](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_LXAmolbu_9c/SDwOx9d5FkI/AAAAAAAABAU/GPvlR6LWWtE/s320/old-lady_walking_stick.jpg) for me.  
According to [this Livestrong article](http://www.livestrong.com/article/374005-what-does-epsom-salt-do-for-soreness/#ixzz22X4KVVQW),Â Magnesium is a primary component of Epsom salt, and is a mineral that the body needs. The mineral helps relax skeletal muscles by flushing lactic acid buildup in the muscles, which may occur during physical exertion, such as a vigorous workout. Magnesium also plays an important role in the absorption of vitamins in the body. It also helps regulate muscle and nerve function. All of these effects significantly influence muscle soreness, which also affects muscle stiffness.  
Next time I may try a towel compress and see how that works. Not sure how often or available a bath will be for me.
