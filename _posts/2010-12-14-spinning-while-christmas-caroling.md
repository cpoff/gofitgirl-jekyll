One of the spin teachers tends to play &#8220;theme&#8221; music around certain holidays. I hadn&#8217;t made it to his Tuesday night spin class in some time. The past two Tuesdays I tried but didn&#8217;t succeed.  
I am glad I Â made it to class tonight. Besides that it was a good workout Boku played almost all Christmas music. And he had sing along pamphlets. It was fun and entertaining.  
It is not good for others to hear me sing. But since I was exercising I couldn&#8217;t really sing all out because I was out of breath.  
I know I haven&#8217;t been blogging lately. The exercise has been pretty good. I have been working out about five times a week. I am going to the yoga studio more lately and hitting spin about three times a week.  
The food department is another story. Ugh! I don&#8217;t really want to talk about it. I just know that I need to get on track in the caloric intake department. I will get there.
