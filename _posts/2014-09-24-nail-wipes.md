I am trying to get my fingernails back in shape and healthy again. They are thin and peeling.  
At a recent visit to the nail salon the woman giving me my mani/pedi gave me some suggestions on how to get my nails growing and strong, which, of course, spurred a blog post titled: [My nail experiment](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/03/nails/).  
I am still working on getting them healthy. It&#8217;s taking a lot longer than I thought it would.  
As I was doing my research for the above mentioned post one thing I read that nail polish remover with acetone shouldn&#8217;t be used.  
[Beauty and Style](http://www.sheknows.com/beauty-and-style/articles/804521/top-tips-to-prevent-and-repair-dry-damaged-nails) said you should avoid nail polish remover. Don’t use nail polish remover more than once or twice a month, if possible. And never use a nail polish remover that contains acetone, which can dry and damage nails. … And, a clear coat of nail polish may also help protect nails.  
I was at Sephora a few months back and asked if they had nail polish remover without acetone. They had one brand: [Josie Maran Bear Naked nail wipes](http://www.josiemarancosmetics.com/bear-naked-nail-wipes-40-wipes.html#.U0IgxNzkvwI).  
I figured there was no way one little wipe would take the polish off of all 10 fingernails, as the package stated. But it did.  
According to the package and website, the three-in-one nail wipes remove nail polish, repair dry cuticles and promote healthy nails naturally.  
The wipes contain Argan oil, which is full of vitamins and antioxidants. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argan_oil), in cosmetics, Argan oil is advocated as moisturizing oil &#8230; Argan oil is traditionally used as a treatment for skin diseases and as a cosmetic oil for skin and hair &#8230;  
As I used the one wipe over each nail I initially had a hard time figuring out if the polish was actually coming off as I couldn&#8217;t tell through the oil on the wipes.  
It took a little elbow grease, especially since I had seven coats of polish on each nail as part of my nail experiment, but all of my polish was removed.  
My nails felt moisturized and not dried out, like they usually do after removing polish with acetone.  
The first packet I bought has 20 wipes and they are portable. So I can take them with me when I travel or throw them in my purse. I also don&#8217;t have to worry about any liquid leaking out. (The second packet I bought has 40 wipes and was $16.)  
The wipes are natural, organic, vegan, animal cruelty-free. The wipes support [NRDC](http://www.nrdc.org) (Natural Resources Defense Counsel). The smell is pleasant and doesn&#8217;t bother me one bit.  
I have been using these nail wipes for months now and absolutely love them. I am still amazed that one little wipe can do that much.  
(I purchased non-acetone nail polish remover from Target and it doesn&#8217;t work. Hardly any polish came off when using it.)

    Bear Naked nail wipes are so much more than just a nail polish remover. They are a little expensive. But as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Josie Maran&#8217;s Bear Naked nail wipes gets 4 1/2 dumbbells.
