I really didn&#8217;t want to exercise today. But with the way I have been eating lately &#8230;  
Today was a busy, but productive day at work. I had a lot of meetings. But I also managed to get a good amount of work done.  
I was trying to catch up on a few e-mails when I realized it was 4 p.m. I try to get to the gym at 4 so I can do 45 minutes to an hour of cardio and then 20-30 minutes of weights, abs, stretching, etc.  
I ended up getting on the bike a little before 4:30 and did 45 minutes of endurance. That&#8217;s about all the endurance routine I can handle.  
The endurance workout on the espinner is moderate resistance and moderate speed all in the saddle. It&#8217;s a lot of work on the glutes, quads and hamstrings.  
I definitely feel a sense of accomplishment when the routine, class, etc. is over. The espinner guy talked about how he looks forward to end of the spin routine because of the endorphin rush, the release and, as I said, the sense of accomplishment.  
Seriously, I am just glad it is over with.
