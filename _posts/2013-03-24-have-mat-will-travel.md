I stole that headline from a friend. But I love it. So I had to use it.  
I don&#8217;t believe I announced to my readers about my trip to Vegas this weekend. Though between my Facebook friends and fellow [Challengers](https://www.facebook.com/events/428522287234578/) and my mom I think I got my readers covered.  
Curt and I have made it a tradition to come to Vegas for the first weekend of March Madness. Our friends Jen and Dave have joined us for the past three years.  
I decided for this long weekend that I would eat and drink whatever I wanted and tomorrow I would get back to my healthy lifestyle.  
(Next week is going to present some major challenges with a planned co-worker lunch and two evening farewell drink and food fests for my boss who is about to retire.)  
I hit the gym every morning this weekend, doing cardio and focusing on the push-up challenge. Damn, my shoulders, arms and upper abs are sore!

I also made sure to get my greens pretty regularly as well.  
Getting greens in was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.  
I have done well with my water intake. Not every meal was a caloric disaster. Oatmeal for breakfasts, lots of greens.  
Of course, there were many beers and drinks.  
Many times when I travel my exercise clothes never leave my suitcase. This time around they came out four times. I also brought my travel yoga mat. And that one did not leave my backpack.  
(I didn&#8217;t have enough room in the suitcase so I shoved it in my backpack, which is pretty amazing that it fit in my backpack.)
