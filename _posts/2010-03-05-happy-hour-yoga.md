The regular Friday evening yoga teacher, Suraya, at my gym is pretty great. But I also love when Ken subs.  
He refers to the Friday evening yoga as Happy Hour.  
I love his teaching style. It was an amazing workout. Man, my thighs were burning and I can still feel that yoga. (Could be the three spin classes this past week, too.)  
I find yoga on Friday evenings a great way to end the workweek &#8230; especially when it is a tough week.
