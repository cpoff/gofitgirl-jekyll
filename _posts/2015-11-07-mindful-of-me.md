I practice a lot of yoga. And I cycle (while teaching indoor cycling) five times a week.  
I teach 11 yoga classes a week (and sometimes a private session) along with my cycle classes every week.  
As a teacher I give to my students physically, emotionally and mentally.  
All teachers need to take care of themselves.  
On Wednesday night while teaching my evening yoga class I started to notice my low back aching (not an uncommon thing).  
Once class was over I noticed it more. And by the time I got home it was quite bothersome.  
I had my dinner and got ready for bed. I then practiced a couple of Restorative Yoga backbends: heart opener over a rolled blanket and supported bridge with a bolster.  
I have Kyphosis (upper hunch back) and Lordosis (lower sway back). Low back discomfort or pain happens at times for me.  
I took it easy the next couple of days while teaching. Cycle I didn&#8217;t ride as hard. I was mindful with my modifications with students in yoga. I like to be helpful with props and getting what students need. I made sure to be careful and not bend over as much as I usually do.  
I didn&#8217;t demonstrate as many yoga poses as normal, which also helped me to work on my language skills. The more I teach the better I get with my language and alignment cues with my students.  
I had a student who was concerned about my back and me carrying my bag of blocks. (I take blocks with me to some of my gym classes.) I told her I was fine. But she insisted on helping me and I let her.  
I was mindful how I picked things up and how I was turning and twisting my body while teaching and in my everyday activities.  
On Thursday afternoon I came home and had lunch. I got comfy and took care of me, which meant taking a nap.  
I practice Restorative Yoga on my own 4-5 times a week. So on Thursday I did a nice Restorative practice of some backbends to help me open up heart center while giving ease to the low back.  
I got to the studio about an hour before my Thursday evening yoga class. I got to experience the Migun. It&#8217;s a type of massage bed. I can&#8217;t really describe it. But it was amazing and I felt so good after.  
[Massage Energy](http://www.massageenergy.com/migun-health-benefits.php) describes the Migun: The Massage Energy Thermal Massage System represents the fusion of acupressure, acupuncture, heat-therapy (moxibustion), chiropractic, and massage. The bed provides electronic heating with Helium-Jade stones; it produces far infrared rays that penetrate the surface of the body, so that the massage heads compress the autonomic nervous system and capillary blood vessels of the neck, thorax, lumbar spine, and sacral region of the pelvis.  The jade “eggs” continually massage along the hamstring muscles of the thighs, which enhances the blood circulation in the lower limbs.  
Yea, that for 40 minutes. I felt supported and calm while using it. And it helped to massage my low back. I especially liked the heat.  
Yesterday I already happened to have a massage appointment. My massage therapist gave me a little extra attention to my low back. As always, I felt great and blissed out after my massage.  
Today my back feels fine.  
I made sure to allow it to fully heal before I took on too much where I could be back to where I was Wednesday night or Thursday.  
Yoga teachers or not, we all need to take care of ourselves and listen to our bodies.
