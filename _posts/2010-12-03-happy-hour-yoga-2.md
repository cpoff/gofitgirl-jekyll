It was a struggle for me to go to yoga class tonight. But I knew I would be happier with myself if I did. I went and I am so happy I did. It was a great way to end my long week and focused day.  
This week has been pretty good in the exercise area. I only missed Tuesday. Monday was spin; Wednesday was yoga; Thursday spin and today yoga.  
Ken, a yoga instructor at my gym, has happy hour yoga on Friday nights. The class is an hour and 15 minutes. Probably for about 50 to 55 minutes we get a good yoga workout and then the last 20 minutes or so are [restorative](http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/991). Ahh, so nice.
