    Baxter, my mentor, and I pose with my Deep Yoga Teacher Training certificate Thursday night.

As of Thursday evening I am an officially certified yoga teacher.  
Piedmont Deep Yoga 2013/2014 teacher training program had its ceremony Thursday night.  
It was a bittersweet evening. The past 10 months I have learned so much. And I have developed relationships with these people every Thursday night, one Saturday month and a couple of Intensive Weekends.  
But it has also been a long and tough road juggling school, homework, home yoga practice, challenges at work, personal life, etc. It was a lot to take on.  
But I am glad I did it. And proud of myself as well.  
Each mentor got up and said something about their yogini/yogi mentees.  
I felt lucky to be the very last one to receive my certificate.  
Curt took video of me getting my certificate from Baxter.

I am heading to Tucson this evening to see my family, get some relaxing time in and teach my very first yoga class tomorrow afternoon, which is called Do Good While You Feel Good, at [Mindful Yoga Studio](http://www.mindfulyogatucson.com). (All proceeds from my class will be donated to [Tucson&#8217;s food bank](http://communityfoodbank.com).)  
As I start getting gigs I will make sure that information gets out there. My fellow teacher training students and I are teaching a summer series at [Piedmont](http://www.piedmontyoga.com). Will post about that soon. I will likely start subbing yoga classes at my gym. And I definitely want to start working one-on-one with people.  
Thank you to everyone who has been so supportive to me as I took this journey. I couldn&#8217;t have done it without my friends and family cheering from the sidelines along the way.
