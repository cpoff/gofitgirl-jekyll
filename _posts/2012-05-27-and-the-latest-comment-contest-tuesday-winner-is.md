    When my readers participate in Comment Contest Tuesday they have the chance to win an Amazon or iTunes gift card. Everyone is eligible since the drawing is random.

&#8230; Nicole!  
The last Comment Contest Tuesday was more than a month ago. I apologize for my tardiness in announcing the winner. Nicole was informed of her winner status recently. Nicole, your Amazon gift card should be sitting in your inbox.  
The April Comment Contest Tuesday asked my readers to tell me what you liked about the new look of the blog and any suggestions. My Webmaster (aka The Husband) and I are working to implement many of the suggestions. Eventually it will be exactly how we want. But it takes time.  
Thanks again to everyone who commented and especially for the suggestions.  
My reader support means so much to me. Truly.  
Be prepared for the next Comment Contest Tuesday coming soon. I am excited about this one. Go Fit Girl&#8217;s yoga expert will be taking your questions. Make sure to keep checking back for that Comment Contest Tuesday &#8230; coming soon.
