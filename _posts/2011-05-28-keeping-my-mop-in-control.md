    I try to keep two elastic ponytail holders with me at all times for the big mop, which is on top of my head.

Yesterday before yoga class started I threw my hair up into a ponytail. The woman sitting next to me asked me if I happened to have an extra elastic band.  
I showed her my wrist with my extra and handed it over. She laughed and accepted. I told her I try to always have two elastic bands on me.  
For yoga I only need one, but for spin class I need two. Because I have so much hair and that pony is all over the place. So I need to braid my ponytail to keep it in control and out of my face.  
I have recently been thinking of cutting my hair and donating it. I am not sure what new style I want so I haven&#8217;t done it yet. I would love to do something completely different and fun and easy.  
But I am hearing from some women I know who had long hair and cut it shorter (and cuter) that it is a much bigger pain to take care of. I would think it would be easier, but I guess not.  
For me the thing is I can&#8217;t stand having my hair in my face. So I need to be able to pull it back, especially when I exercise. When I don&#8217;t feel like doing anything to my hair I can just pull it back in a pony or some sort of bun thing&#8211;it&#8217;s not really a bun, but I am not quite sure how to describe it.
