Normally I work from home on Fridays. But I have to go in to the office tomorrow. So I worked from home today.  
Which meant that I was able to go to noon spin at the gym. It was a great workout, as always.  
That is one of the negatives with my company moving to South San Francisco. I can&#8217;t run off to the gym for an extended lunch break and take a spin class or yoga class or whatever it is I want to do.  
I can work out at the gym we have at work. I usually work out in that gym 2-3 times a week at the end of the day. I try to use the [espinner](http://www.spinning.com/spinning-shop-spinner-bikes/spinner-bike-eSpinner.asp?source=googlebase), if it is available, and lucky for me it has been available every time I have wanted to use it.  
After my espinner &#8220;class,&#8221; if I have time, I also do some weights or leg work (lunges and squats&#8211;man, I hate those!) or some abs. My workouts in the work gym tend to be 45 minutes to an hour. That&#8217;s pretty good.
