So after about a week and half of not being at the gym I went back today. I did yoga this morning. And my friend Alex joined me. It felt really good to stretch and move again.  
  
Tomorrow the plan is to do a cardio machine. I wanted to do the spin class, but I am going to take it slow. Plus I am still a little congested and coughing. But it is definitely a whole lot better.
