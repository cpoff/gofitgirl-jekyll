Alright, today&#8217;s Comment Contest Tuesday runs in connection with [September&#8217;s Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/09/september-monthly-challenge/).  
The Monthly Challenge asks readers to think about the things they donâ€™t have time for (a fitness class, shopping for fresh veggies instead of eating/serving frozen meals, cooking at home regularly, going for nightly walks after dinner, getting up in the morning for a 20-30 minute yoga practice, making it to the gym at least three times a week, going to bed at a regular time, etc.)  
This Comment Contest Tuesday, starting today and running through Tuesday, Sept. 17, asks readers to post their challenges and wants and needs. Other readers can suggest ways to achieve these challenges.  
For each challenge a reader posts their name will get thrown into a random drawing. For each suggestion to challenge posted, the reader will get their name thrown in a random drawing twice.  
This is a two-week long Comment Contest Tuesday, as I want to encourage readers to post their many challenges and for my readers to take the time to come up with solutions for each other.  
You have a full two weeks to post challenges and solutions. Every single challenge post gets your name thrown in one time into the random drawing (post three challenges and get your name in the hat [UA hat, of course] three times). Every single solution post to a challenge gets your name thrown in two times into the random drawing (post two solutions and get your name in the hat [same UA hat, Bear Down!] four times).  
You have from today to Tuesday, Sept. 17 noon (Pacific time) to post challenges and solutions. Only comments below count. Facebook comments, Tweets, e-mails, etc. DON&#8217;T count.  
Just a reminder, in order for this Monthly Challenge to be successful we need a lot of comments in Comment Contest Tuesday. And lots of comments and participation means Monthly Challenges will continue.  
Thanks for your support!
