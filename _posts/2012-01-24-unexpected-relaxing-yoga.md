    In class tonight, we did a similar pose. The only difference was we also used a strap. http://www.spiritualhealingportal.com/

I had so many ideas swirling in my head for tonight&#8217;s post that I wasn&#8217;t sure what to write about.  
At first I was going to write about the 7-day super cleanse, which I will start tomorrow. But you will have to wait for that &#8230;  
The second possible post was to write about how I lost another 2.2 pounds. Another week of really paying attention to what I was eating and really planning my meals and snacks.  
And the third idea was what happened in yoga class tonight. So that is what you get. What I learned in yoga class tonight.  
I attended Vickie&#8217;s Hatha class tonight.Â As she started the class talking about running on adrenaline and trying to relax she decided to change the focus of the class. Vickie mentioned [cortisol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol), which is released in the body when stressed. She said when we practice Restorative yoga the hormone is reduced. Sounds like a good reason to me to practice more often.  
So lucky for me and the rest of the students we got a mellow Restorative class. It was so relaxing and lovely.  
Vickie reminded us that we should take care of ourselves this evening and be kind to ourselves. Of course, as soon as I got home I had to make dinner, prepare a green smoothie for my cleanse, wash the dishes, eat dinner, write this post &#8230; (Luckily I already have clothes ready for work tomorrow. I knew this week would be a little hectic so I got clothes ready for the week last night. I know, that seems a little intense. But it makes me a little less stressed. So it&#8217;s worth it.)
