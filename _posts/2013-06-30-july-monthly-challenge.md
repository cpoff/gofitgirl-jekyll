    We don&#8217;t have a lot of sugar in our house. This is where we hold the little but of sugar we do keep around.

Go Fit Girl&#8217;s July Monthly Challenge is brought to you by your fellow GFG! readers and Challengers. (A recent [Comment Contest Tuesday](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10601) got all kinds of ideas for many Monthly Challenges, including July&#8217;s.)  
Thanks for the ideas, ladies.  
**Nutrition:** Reduce sugar intake. Reducing refined sugars would be even better. But I realize that is difficult.  
With it being summer there are lots of yummy fruits and vegetables available.  
Try to find ways to not use processed foods&#8211;that&#8217;s where a lot of that refined sugar hides. Start reading labels.  
A simple change: make dessert fresh fruit and plain greek yogurt or just fresh fruit. Instead of eating a cookie have an apple instead.  
[A Livestrong article credits FamilyEducation.com](http://www.livestrong.com/article/244026-foods-with-refined-sugars/) as saying, more than two-thirds of the refined sugar used in the United States is added to processed or manufactured foods.  
**Exercise:** Let&#8217;s do a plank challenge this month. A few people have asked for one. So let&#8217;s go for it. Let&#8217;s make our goal to get to a 2-minute plank over the month. At work we did a 4-minute plank challenge. I dropped out of the challenge once we hit 3:30. It was bad for my back and I felt that it wasn&#8217;t enough of a benefit to feel discomfort/pain elsewhere.

  * First week (July 1-7) work toward 45 seconds. Week 1: Plank for 30 seconds once or twice; plank for 45 seconds once or twice.
  * Second week  (July 8-14) work toward 1:15. Week 2: Plank for 1 minute  once or twice; plank for 1:15 once or twice.
  * Third week (July 15-21) work toward 1:30. Week 3: Plank for 1:15 once or twice; plank for 1:30 once or twice.
  * Fourth week (July 22-28) work toward 2 minutes. Week 4: Plank for 1:45 twice or three times; plank for 2 minutes once.
  * Half of Fifth week (July 29-31) maintain 2 minutes. Hold plank 2 minutes once, twice or three times.

Feel free to do variations of plank: forearm plank, full plank, side plank &#8230;  
I think for July and August this will be an extra exercise challenge as many may be going on vacation: A vacation fitness challenge – if you are traveling this summer, find a way to work in a new type of fitness experience that you would not normally do at home (kayaking, rock climbing, hiking, standup paddle boarding,
