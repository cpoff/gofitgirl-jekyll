    My yummy blueberry lemon drop from last weekend.

Sorry for the lack of posts lately. Curt and I were in Portland last weekend and I didn&#8217;t do anything remotely healthy to write about.  
And then coming back to a hectic and crazy time at work &#8230;  
When Curt and I were in Portland last weekend we were at a restaurant called Jake&#8217;s having a delicious late-night dinner. I was just having water with with dinner as I had consumed numerous beers throughout the day.  
But as we were sitting at the bar I kept watching the bartenders make drinks and especially a really yummy looking one. I figured out it was the blueberry lemon drop.  
So I had them make me one. Oh wow, it was delicious. So I had a second one. Yum!  
As I was scooping out the blueberries after the glass had been emptied of liquid Curt and I started talking about blueberries. (Yup, we&#8217;re that exciting!)  
I said something about how blueberries had antioxidants. Curt asked me what that meant. And I admitted that I really didn&#8217;t know.  
So that, of course, inspired a post.  
According to [Discovery Health: How Stuff Works](http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/food-nutrition/facts/antioxidant1.htm), as the name implies, antioxidants are substances that are capable of counteracting the damaging, but normal, effects of the physiological process of oxidation in animal tissue. Antioxidants are nutrients (vitamins and minerals) as well as enzymes (proteins in your body that assist in chemical reactions). They are believed to play a role in preventing the development of such chronic diseases as cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Rheumatoid arthritis and cataracts. [

According to this [WebMD article](http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/antioxidants-in-fruits), antioxidants are important disease-fighting compounds. Scientists believe they help prevent and repair the stress that comes from oxidation, a natural process that occurs during normal cell function.  
Blueberries are considered a superfood.  
[Another WebMD article](http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/superfoods-everyone-needs) says: Imagine a superfood &#8212; not a drug &#8212; powerful enough to help you lower your cholesterol, reduce your risk of heart disease and cancer, and, for an added bonus, put you in a better mood.  
Wow, blueberries are amazing and they taste good.
