Yesterday I attended a two-hour yoga workshop. It was refreshing and freeing and a great workout. It was a great way to start the new year and end the last year.  
Today I attended my regular Sunday Vinyasa class. That class is always an amazing cardio workout.  
Last week I decided I seriously need to make a change with my caloric intake. I know I have gained weight. I am not sure how much.  
Last week I was home visiting family, eating lots of homecooked Mexican food and then spent a few days in San Diego eating every meal out and not healthy.  
When I lost weight many years ago I lost weight over the holidays. So I really have no excuses. I need to get back to my goal weight. And that&#8217;s that.
