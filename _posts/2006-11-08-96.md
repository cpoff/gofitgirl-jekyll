I started Weight Watchers on October 18, and since then I have lost 9.6 pounds. Woo-hoo! I only have to lose 6 more pounds to make it to my goal that WW has set for me. I personally would like to lose 15 more pounds.  
And I found out today that if you get to your WW weight goal by the end of your program (ours is 16 weeks) you get free membership for life!  
So now the exercising part must really get going. I hadn&#8217;t gotten into it since we were getting ready to move and then we moved over the weekend. Once our place is more organized I can really get back into my cardio with Maya. The good thing is I have a great neighborhood to walk around in. I plan on doing some exploring this weekend.
