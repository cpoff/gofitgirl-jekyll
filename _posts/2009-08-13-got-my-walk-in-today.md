Mia and I met this afternoon and took a 20-minute walk nearby.  
The weather was beautiful, it was nice to get some fresh air and chat it up with my friend. And I got a little exericse in.  
We want to make that a regular occurrence. After I take a walk I am so much more productive and have more energy for the rest of my work day.
