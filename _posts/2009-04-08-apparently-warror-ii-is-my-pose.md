In yoga class on Monday my teacher Sarah told me that [Warrior II](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/495) is my pose while we all were in Warrior II pose.  
So, I am assuming that means I do the pose pretty well. She even told me I could go lower to get closer to parallel to the ground.  
I have gone to yoga the past three days. Monday and this morning and yesterday to Sean&#8217;s class during my lunch break.
