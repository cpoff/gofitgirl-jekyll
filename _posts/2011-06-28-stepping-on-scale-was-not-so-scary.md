[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5396" title="Go Fit Girl FB page" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Go-Fit-Girl-FB-page-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Go-Fit-Girl-FB-page.jpg)I did a weigh-in today and I was surprised and happy to find that I am only 4 pounds from my goal weight. I am not really sure how or why that happened. But I am OK with it.  
About the first two years after I lost my roughly 30 pounds I was able to maintain rather easily. The past two years have been a little more of a struggle. But the highest weight I have been from my goal weight has been 9 pounds.  
I decided to look at my Before and After pics again and post on my [Go Fit Girl! Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/GoFitGirl) and have a [link here as well](share.shutterfly.com/action/welcome?sid=8EZtHLVq0as1c). I am having issues sharing the link from Facebook.  
I am still proud of my weight loss and happy with the fact that I have maintained pretty well over the years. The only new clothes I want to buy are in the sizes I own now. I purposely got rid of most of my clothes after my weight loss. I didn&#8217;t want to have them as a fall back and Bay Area closets are teeny tiny. I have no space for bigger clothes.
