My webmaster/IT guy (aka The Husband) created a new pageÂ on Go Fit Girl! called [My Yoga Classes](http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/).  
On this page I list all (two so far) yoga classes on my schedule.  
As I start subbing and possibly pick up my own regular class or two I will update the page.  
I also have a little information on private one-on-one sessions. For more information on that you can e-mail me at ann@gofitgirl.com.  
You can find the My Yoga Classes tab on Go Fit Girl&#8217;s homepage.  
If you are in the Bay Area: The graduates from Deep Yoga 2013/2014 class are hosting a Summer Series of yoga classes starting next Thursday, July 10 at 7 p.m. at [Piedmont Yoga Studio](http://www.piedmontyoga.com/#!summer-student-classes/ciuq).  
The Summer Series is every Thursday night through August 21. I am teaching with my friend Sandra on July 24. And I plan to attend most classes to support my fellow new trained teachers. Hope to see you there.
