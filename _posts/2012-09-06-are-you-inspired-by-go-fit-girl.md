    Even while traveling (in the UK) I try to keep my readers informed.

Recently I debated if I should keep up with the Go Fit Girl! blog. It&#8217;s a decent amount of work. I consider it my second job, which I don&#8217;t get paid for, and it is rather time-consuming.  
I do enjoy maintaining it and doing the research and learning things and sharing it all with my readers. But I had started to wonder if it was worth it.  
I love getting comments. But I rarely get them.  
Occasionally I hold something called Comment Contest Tuesday to generate comments and get my readers more involved. But I have to say it is like pulling teeth to get people to comment. And with Comment Contest Tuesday my readers have a chance to win a prize. Seems pretty easy to me.  
When you comment you have to give your name and e-mail address. Only your name is published. And it doesn&#8217;t have to be your full name or your real name.  
The reason you have to fill in your e-mail is to help eliminate spammers. I won&#8217;t ever share your e-mail. And the only time I use it is to alert you that you won the random drawing for Comment Contest Tuesday and to send you your prize.  
Recently people have been coming to me and telling me how much they love reading my blog. Some of them I had no idea they were even readers.  
Some women have told me they read regularly but never comment. Some say they don&#8217;t know what to say. Well, I know that we all have something to say. Don&#8217;t be afraid to comment.  
I have been told I inspire, motivate and my readers just enjoy reading what I write about.  
The more people I talk to the more I realize the blog is important to me and to my readers and it must go on.  
Here&#8217;s what some of my readers have to say:

  * My mom and I read it together.
  * You inspire me.
  * Your blog is awesome!! I totally love it.
  * I like to share things with my daughters that empower women.
  * I love the way you write.

So no worries. The blog will go on. And I appreciate all of my readers and your support.  
And I would love to hear from you in any form: in person; via e-mail ann@gofitgirl.com; [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GoFitGirl); [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoFitGirl); comments on the [blog](http://gofitgirl.com).
