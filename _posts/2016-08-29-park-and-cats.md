I taught two yoga classes in the park this month.  
Practicing yoga under the sky with the cool grass below our feet and a view of trees and children playing was a great and fun experience.  
I had students from my various public yoga classes join me for both Yoga in the Park with Ann classes.  
Connecting with the earth, the ground, nature, each other under a blue or gray sky (one day was a little cloudy) with a green cool floor and green walls with the sounds of the outside world coming into our yoga class must be done one more time before the skies become gray and cold and wet in Portland.  
Which means I&#8217;m going to teach one more Yoga in the Park with Ann next month.

Purringtons is a different way for shelter cats to interact with humans and allow prospective adopters to see a cat in a home like environment. &#8230; Visits help with socialization of the cats, which lead to adoptions, according to the website.  
You can visit the cats while munching on some light fare and sipping a meowmosa, wine, beer, coffee or tea.  
Purringtons also has [Purr Yoga](http://purringtonscatlounge.com/home/events/event/yoga-cats-and-you-purr-yoga/).  
My friend Karen and I visited Purringtons last year to visit with the cats while sipping meowmosas.  
Last Sunday, Aug. 21, we attended our first Purr Yoga class.  
We took an hour-long yoga class with the adorable, furry cats as they walked around, meowed, hissed, cuddled and just hung out.  
After the yoga class we had a chance to hang out with the cats for a bit.  
The cost of the class helps to support the cats and a local yoga teacher. It&#8217;s a win-win.
