We are in Napa right now &#8230; enjoying a relaxing weekend.  
Last night I went down into the vending area to get some ice. I noticed right next to the ice machine was a door with a sign that said Exercise Room. I peeked in there. It was dark and small, but there were at least 4 cardio machines in there. I had no idea they even had one. Too bad I didn&#8217;t bring my tennies or the urge to work out.
