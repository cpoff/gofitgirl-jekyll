There was a lot of chicken making and eating in the house so far this week. OK, well not a lot, but more than the norm.  
One recipe I made for dinner one night was new and super simple and quite delicious.  
The other recipe was one that I have been making for years. And it usually just comes out for special occasions &#8230; like the Kansas City Royals playing in the World Series for the first time in 29 years.  
**Sauced &#8216;n&#8217; simmered dijon chicken**

The first recipe I made was another one of Hungry Girl&#8217;s creations: [sauced &#8216;n&#8217; simmered dijon chicken](http://www.hungry-girl.com/weighin/show/2190-low-calorie-easy-recipes-dijon-chicken-sweet-and-sour-meatloaf).  
I was looking for something that was simple with few ingredients. And I just happened to have all the ingredients needed already.  
If you are looking for a quick and easy dinner to make this is a good one.  
I did alter the recipe because once the chicken was cooked it didn&#8217;t look like a lot of food, like the picture did.  
Curt asked if we had any rice. And I have the [brown rice from Trader Joe&#8217;s](http://cooktj.com/node/706), which you can throw in the microwave and have hot and ready in three minutes.  
I also made some carrots to go along with the meal and even poured a little balsamic vinegar over the carrots for a little tasty pizazz.  
The sauce on the chicken was excellent and so simple. If you aren&#8217;t a meat eater, I would recommend trying the sauce on tofu. I think it would be rather tasty. (Though I haven&#8217;t tried the recipe this way. I may have to at some point.)  
**Baked &#8220;fried&#8221; chicken**

The second was a recipe I found on the box of Safeway corn flakes years ago for baked &#8220;fried&#8221; chicken.  
I made the baked &#8220;fried&#8221; chicken because it is one of Curt&#8217;s favorites. It tends to come out for certain special sporting events.  
I taught a yoga class last night and didn&#8217;t get home until close to 9. So I prepared the chicken ahead of time and had The Husband throw the chicken in the oven before I got home from class.  
The [recipe from Epicurious](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Oven-Fried-Chicken-with-a-Corn-Flake-Crust-232683) is very similar to how I make my baked &#8220;fried&#8221; chicken. But here&#8217;s what I did:

  * Six drumsticks (you can obviously make more&#8211;you will just have to adjust the corn flakes and butter used)
  * 1 1/4 cup of corn flakes crushed
  * Dash of salt and pepper and red pepper flakes (optional)
  * 2 tablespoons of egg whites
  * 1 tablespoon of fat free milk
  * 1/8 cup of melted Country Crock spread

To make these more healthy friendly you can remove the skin from the chicken, which I didn&#8217;t do. But I may next time.  
I poured the corn flakes into a sandwich baggie and added salt, pepper and red pepper flakes (optional) into the bag. I then crushed the flakes with a rolling pin.  
I poured the flakes into one bowl. In a second bowl I added the egg whites and milk. I hardly used any of the egg whites/milk concoction. Just enough the coat the chicken so the corn flakes would stick.  
I sprayed Cooking Spray canola oil on a baking sheet. I took each drumstick and rolled it around in the egg whites/milk. Then dipped it in the corn flakes and put it on the baking sheet.  
Once all the drumsticks were covered in the corn flakes I melted 2 tablespoons of Country Crock spread and poured a little over each drumstick.  
Set the oven at 350 degrees and bake for 45-50 minutes.  
**Easy to make and marinate chicken breasts**

Another easy chicken recipe my mother-in-law shared with me years ago is to marinate chicken breasts in light Italian dressing.  
I took a cooking class years ago with my dad, Hilda and Curt in Napa. Our teacher [Julie](http://cookingwithjulie.com) told us most marinades only need to &#8220;soak&#8221; for an hour.  
I like to buy the chicken breast that is frozen and preferably individually packaged. I take one or two breasts out the night before or morning of the day we are planning to have them for dinner.  
When I was still working full time I would defrost during the day. I would come home from work and put the chicken breasts into a baggie to marinate in the fridge while I headed to yoga class.  
Once I got home I would fire up the George Foreman grill and about 10 minutes later we would have an easy and healthy dinner.  
The marinated chicken breast in dressing may seem like a no-brainer to some of you. But to someone like me who is a novice in the kitchen thought it was brilliant and still make chicken this way pretty regularly.  
Make sure to check out the [Recipes tab](http://gofitgirl.com/recipes/) for information on these recipes and others as well.  
So there you go, cookin&#8217; chicken in the kitchen. Happy Wednesday!
