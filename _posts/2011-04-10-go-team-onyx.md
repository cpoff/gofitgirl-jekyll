At work I signed up for a [virtual walk to raise funds for MMRF](http://support.themmrf.org/site/TR/RaceforResearch/General?px=1454694&pg=personal&fr_id=1270).  
My plan was to do the virtual walk via the couch.  
I went to an hour and half Vinyasa Yoga class and then Curt and I put in our garden. That is a lot of physical labor.  
Once done with all of that Curt and I headed to McNally&#8217;s for a much needed beer.
