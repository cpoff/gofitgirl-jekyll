We arrived in Barcelona late Satirday afternoon. We have already had amazing food, delicious sangria and so much fun.  
When I travel, whether domestic or international I struggle with getting in enough water every day.  
I do travel with my own water bottle, which I can fill up.  
I noticed yesterday as we did a lot of walking that there were many drinking fountains around town, whether for a sip or to fill up.  
I love that idea.
