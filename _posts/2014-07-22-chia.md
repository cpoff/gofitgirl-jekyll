    Chia seeds I purchased at the grocery.

A friend at work recently recommended I try chia seeds. I have heard of them before and knew they were supposed to be good for you. But I hadn&#8217;t sought them out.  
Recently at the grocery I saw them and decided to buy them and try them out.  
My friend uses the seeds in her morning smoothies.  
I don&#8217;t make morning smoothies. So I have been adding a tablespoon of them into my 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt snack.  
I like the texture and consistency of the seeds.  
I also like the health benefits. (There are some claims that chia seeds help you lose weight. Not sure if that is true. And frankly, I don&#8217;t want to explore it. A healthy and balanced diet is what helps you lose and maintain weight. There is no quick fix or pill for that.)  
According to [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/truth-about-chia), c<span style="color: #000000;">hia is an edible seed that comes from the desert plant </span><i style="color: #000000;">Salvia hispanica</i><span style="color: #000000;">, grown in Mexico dating back to Mayan and Aztec cultures. &#8230; Chia seeds are a concentrated food containing healthy omega-3 fatty acids, carbohydrates, protein, fiber, antioxidants and calcium.</span>  
[Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/444471-top-ten-health-benefits-of-chia-seeds/) lists the top 10 health benefits of chia seeds: high in fiber; increases Omega-3 fats; contains niacin and thiamine; source of selenium; increases iron intake; contains calcium; source of maganese; provide phosphorous; source of magnesium; and contains copper.  
The Livestrong article says you can mix a tablespoon of chia seeds with water, which can be used as a replacement for an egg in baked goods. Hmmm, interesting.  
The nutritional information on one large egg: 71 calories; 5 grams fat; 0 grams carbohydrates, 0 fiber; 6 grams protein.  
And the nutritional information on 1 tablespoon of Foxy chia seeds: 53 calories; 3 grams fat; 4.5 grams carbohydrates; 4 grams fiber; 1.5 grams protein.  
My snack of a 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt and one tablespoon of chia seeds is yummy, filling and contains: 113 calories; 8 grams fat; 4.5 grams carbohydrates; 4 grams fiber; 7.5 grams protein.  
Chia seeds seem like a nice supplement to certain foods with some added nutrition.
