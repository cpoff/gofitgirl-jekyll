    A co-worker/friend gave me a DonorsChoose.org gift card to put toward a teacher&#8217;s request.

A friend/co-worker gave me a [DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org) gift card for Christmas.  
I could donate my $25 to any school/classroom listed on the website.  
There are so many schools listed. Just for schools in Oakland there are 207 and the ones I reviewed were all high poverty schools.  
How did I choose?  
This is how I narrowed it down. I wanted a school in Oakland, since I live in Oakland. I wanted a high poverty school and my money to go toward some sort of reading program. AND I wanted to grant the teacher&#8217;s wish by paying off what was left of his request, with my gift card and some of my own money.  
In other words, I wanted the teacher and the classroom to get what they wanted and really, what they needed in the request.  
The program was titled [I Can Read!](http://www.donorschoose.org/project/i-can-read/941352/?verify=-165885046) Mr. Cline teaches kindergarten and first grade and the kids stay with him for two years. On his request he said, 90% of the students are low-income, and 90% are English language learners. Most have not been to preschool, so I am their first exposure to formal education.  
Mr. Cline&#8217;s request was for multiple books for each level of reader in his classroom, which included books titled _Here Comes Little Chimp_ and _Sam&#8217;s Picnic_.  
Mr. Cline meets the various reading groups at a reading table. He said, they are excited to see the book they will be learning that day and practicing over the next weeks. &#8230; My students love to read because they truly believe that they are readers.  
Wow, I was won over when I read that. As a kid I loved to read and reading came easy for me. In elementary school I was three reading levels ahead of my grade. In junior high we had to do a book report on any book we wanted. I picked _Jane Eyre_. They next time I read that book was for a college literature class.  
I used to be a mentor and worked with a girl who struggled with reading. Until I worked with her I never really understood the power of reading, especially for someone struggling with it.  
I was already happy and excited about my choice when I made it. But the e-mail I received from Mr. Cline  the next morning made it even better. I feel so lucky that I am able to help others love to read as much as I did and still do (even though I don&#8217;t read as much as I would like).
