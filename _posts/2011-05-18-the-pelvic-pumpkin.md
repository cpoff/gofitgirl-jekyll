Huh?  
In yoga sometimes the instructor will tell you to imagine certain things are happening with your body. It is hard to describe.  
Today Baxter had us imagine that our pelvis was a hollowed out pumpkin and then proceeded to tell us that our [sacrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum) was the A section of an audience facing a stage and to the left and right of that were the B seats and so on and so forth. Sometimes visualizing helps you to get deeper into your practice or pose.  
We held some lunges for quite some time. And man,I could really feel the back of my thighs burning from the [endurance ride I had yesterday](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=4951). I had to back off a couple of times. And Baxter even praised me once for [finding and recognizing my edge](http://www.fitnessgoop.com/2010/07/finding-your-edge-in-yoga/).  
When I came home from yoga tonight The Husband informed me he purchased dinner at Market Hall (gourmet type food in our hood). I asked if it was healthy. And his response was, define healthy. I must not have told him I am being really careful with my caloric intake these days or apparently he doesn&#8217;t keep up with Go Fit Girl! as often as he should! ðŸ™‚  
It was thoughtful for him to bring dinner home and I am going to make it work. The fish filets are fried. So I am still deciding if I am going to eat a whole filet and take off the &#8220;fried&#8221; part or eat half a filet with the &#8220;fried&#8221; part. There is a polenta salad and some seasoned potatoes. I will have just a little of each. Since I am pretty hungry and know that small portions are NOT going to fill me up I am also steaming some carrots to help fulfill my hunger. I may even have a little salad.  
I gotta go eat. Good night.
