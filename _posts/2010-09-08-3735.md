Today is Day 3 of getting back to my healthy lifestyle.  
I started counting points again with Weight Watchers on Monday. I am not attending meetings (probably should) or doing anything online. My years with WW gave me many of the tools I need to continue on my own.  
I am trying to mix up my workouts&#8211;not so spin focused (tho. that usually means I can eat more!). Monday there were no classes at the gym (that is normally my noon spin class day) so I did a little time on the treadmill and then did a self-taught spin class on the bike. Tuesday was yoga. And today was Zumba. Tomorrow will either be spin or kickboxing.  
I am determined this time to get back to my goal weight. I have to stop making excuses and lose that 9 pounds.
