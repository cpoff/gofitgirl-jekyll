That is what my spin teacher, Jennifer, said one time.  
I have to say spin is the hardest class I have ever taken. But I make myself go. It is an amazing cardio workout.  
After spin Jennifer teaches an abs/core half an hour class. That is a great class, too.  
So that is what I did this morning. I feel good. I may need a nap in a bit.
