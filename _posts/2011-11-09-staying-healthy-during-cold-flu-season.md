Flu and cold season is upon us.  
I got my [flu shot at the end of September](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=6663). My company provides a free flu shot clinic every September/October. I know there are people out there who refuse to get a shot or don&#8217;t believe in them. OK, that&#8217;s fine.  
Here are my tips&#8211;for those who get flu shots and those who don&#8217;t&#8211;on staying as healthy as possible this cold and flu season and all year long:  
Wash your hands after you use the toilet. (I know that seems obvious &#8230;)  
Wash your hands before you eat.  
When you cough or sneeze try to use a tissue or your inside elbow.  
If you sneeze or cough into your hands, wash them.  
If you are sick, please stay home. Don&#8217;t bring your germs and cooties to work.  
If your kids are sick, please don&#8217;t bring them to work because they can&#8217;t go to daycare or school. I don&#8217;t want their germs or cooties either.  
Whenever I clean the bathroom or kitchen I use [Clorox wipes](http://www.clorox.com/products/clorox-disinfecting-wipes/) to clean counters and toilets, etc. I also use the wipes to clean knobs, light switches, handles, door knobs, anything we touch regularly.  
I don&#8217;t do this as often. But I highly recommend going around your house and using wipes on light switches, door knobs and remote controls.  
Carry [hand sanitizer](http://www.target.com/p/up-up-Hand-Sanitizer-2-oz/-/A-11633442) in your purse (if you have a purse) for those times when washing your hands is not an option or no soap is available.  
Clorox or [Lysol wipe](http://www.lysol.com/cleaning-products/disinfecting-wipes/disinfecting-wipes-4in1) your cell phone at least once a week.  
Wipe down with disinfectant the cardio machine you just sweated on. (Sometimes I clean it before I use it since I know a lot of people don&#8217;t clean it after they use it.)  
Clorox or Lysol wipe your desk, phone, keyboard and mouse at least once a week.  
When I leave a public restroom, including the one at work, after I wash my hands I hold on to my paper towels and open the door with the paper towels so my clean hands don&#8217;t touch a handle that is surely dirty.  
We can&#8217;t possibly clean every thing we touch (I know my keys must be so germy and gross). But being more aware is already helpful and will keep you healthier.  
If you do get sick stay home, don&#8217;t take your cooties to work, get lots of rest, eat healthy, drinks lots of fluids. And feel better soon.  
Any other suggestions you got, readers? I would love to hear them.
