    Supported Setu Bandha (Supported Bridge Pose) is one of my favorite poses and is a great release for my lower back.

In the last all-day Saturday yoga teacher training there was a huge focus on standing poses. The second half we worked on chanting, which meant a lot of sitting.  
The next day my low back hurt.  
Standing and sitting are both hard on my lower back.  
Normally on Sundays I attend a rather active Vinyasa yoga class.  I decided for that day that practice was not appropriate for my body.  
I did a little research on yoga for back pain. Baxter, who is one of my yoga teachers and the director and a teacher of my yoga teacher training, specializes in back care. He writes for the Yoga Journal blog. You can find one of his back care posts [right here](http://blogs.yogajournal.com/doctorsorders/2012/08/16/yoga-for-low-back-pain/).  
Baxter also has a blog where he writes with others called [Yoga for Healthy Aging](http://yogaforhealthyaging.blogspot.com/). I decided to search that blog and came upon a [sequence Baxter put together for low back care](http://yogaforhealthyaging.blogspot.com/2012/01/featured-series-low-back-care.html).  
I decided to go with a gentle approach for my back care home practice:

  * [Balasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/475) (Child&#8217;s Pose)
  * [Adho Muka Savanasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/491) (Downward Facing Dog)
  * [Urdhva Hatasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2489) (Upward Salute)*
  * [Uttanasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/478) with hands on yoga block/brick (Full Forward Bend) *
  * Work these two * poses dynamically about 6 times or whatever feels good for you
  * [Ardha Uttanasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2490) with hands on yoga block/brick (Standing Half Forward Bend)
  * [Marjayasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2468) (Cat) / [Bitilasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2467) (Cow) dynamically about 6 times
  * [Bhujangasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/471) (Cobra Pose)
  * [Sphinx Pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2464)
  * Balasana
  * Lie down on back, bring knees to chest, roll legs and knees to right hold and then to left and hold
  * Supported [Setu Bandha](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/472) (like picture above)
  * [Bharadajasana I](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/487) (Bharadvaja&#8217;s Twist)
  * [Marichyasana III](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/691) (Marichi&#8217;s Pose)
  * [Ardha Matsyendrasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/485) (Half Lord of the Fishes Pose)

**(Insert Baxter&#8217;s back care sequence linked above)**

  * Reclined Hip Stretch (dynamic)
  * [Supta Padagusthasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/483) (Reclining Big Toe Pose&#8211;static)
  * Hunting Dog Pose (static)
  * Half Dog at the Wall Pose (static)
  * [Salabhasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/789) (Locust Pose&#8211;dynamic)
  * Knees to Chest (dynamic)

**(Back to my sequence. My body called for Baddha Konasana. You should listen to what your body wants.)**

  * [Baddha Konasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/486) (Bound Angle Pose)
  * Ardha Baddha Konasana (Seated Forward Bound Angle Pose)
  * Savasana (Corpse Pose) with rolled up blanket or bolster under knees

The practice released some of the pain in my lower back. I made sure to take it easy in my yoga class on Monday evening. By Tuesday evening my back felt back to my old self again.  
After my practice The Husband and I went to shop for a new La-Z-Boy. I wasn&#8217;t excited to be standing around looking at recliners. But I found out that when shopping for recliners you are sitting and appreciating the lumbar support of the La-Z-Boy.
