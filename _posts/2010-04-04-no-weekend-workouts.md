So Friday I felt like I might be getting sick. But I thought it could be allergies.  
I didn&#8217;t go to yoga for a variety of reasons on Friday night. Work allowed us to leave at 1 Friday afternoon. I stayed until about 3. I was tired and just came home. I ended up bringing some filing home and just watching a movie and doing a little work.  
Saturday I woke up with some chest cold sort of thing. So I didn&#8217;t go to the gym for my two hours of normal Saturday work out.  
Normally on Easter Curt and I plant our garden. We didn&#8217;t this year because of the rain. And it worked out since I am still not feeling well. It would have been tough to do&#8211;that&#8217;s a major workout doing all that weeding and tilling, etc.
