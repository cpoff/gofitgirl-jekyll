I have been doing yoga on a regular basis for almost two years. I normally practice yoga about three times a week.  
I have seriously come a long way. But the thing with yoga is you are always improving and getting better and stronger. I don&#8217;t know if you ever master it? Some might disagree. But I feel with yoga there is always room to grow and improve.  
Anyway, I suck at the balance poses. I actually dislike when we have a huge focus on balance. I get frustrated because I can&#8217;t stay up for very long without falling over.  
A lot of that has to do with core strength. And I am understanding better how to use my core strength to keep me up in certain poses.  
Yesterday in yoga we did [Tree Pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496), which I am getting much better at. And I am proud to say I only fell out of the pose once on one side.
