    Tomorrow morning at 2 a.m. it will be time to Fall Back (unless you are in Arizona and a few other parts of North America).

Ugh, I seriously hate time change.  
Most places in North America will Fall Back tomorrow at 2 a.m. Most areas of the world have already Fallen Back.  
You can see the whole [schedule here](http://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/events.html).  
My body just doesn&#8217;t do well whether we lose an hour or gain an hour.  
I wrote about [Springing Forward in March](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=8812).  
If I have time tomorrow I would like to take the 6 p.m. Restorative Yoga class. I think that will really help me sleep better tomorrow night. (My schedule is gonna be a little tight tomorrow so I hope to make it to Restorative Yoga&#8211;if not, maybe I can practice on my own&#8211;take my own tips below.)  
Sometimes the Restorative yoga teacher gives us tips if we are having trouble sleeping. A good stretch while lying on your back: Spread your arms and hands and your feet and yours legs and then let go.  
My advise to all who need some extra help tomorrow morning:

  * Don’t go to bed too late tonight.
  * Make sure you have breakfast tomorrow.
  * Try not to eat a lot of crap. Stick to fruits and veggies as snacks instead of sugary or salty foods.
  * Drink lots of water tomorrow (but also today and always).
  * Exercise. (I will be going to a yoga class tomorrow morning) Even going for a walk will be helpful.
  * Keep up the exercise throughout the week, especially on Monday. It will be tough, but well worth it.
  * If you do nap tomorrow (I love my weekend naps), don’t nap too late.
  * If caffeine really affects you (doesn’t really for me) maybe cut back tomorrow and definitely don’t have it too late in the day.
  * Try to start winding your day down an hour before you go to bed. If you normally go to bed around 10, then at 9 make sure you are done for the day and ready for Monday’s workday. Do something relaxing for that hour: read a book, knit, lounge. Even practice a Restorative Yoga pose or two. A few poses I like are: [Legs Up the Wall](http://www.thebalancedbeing.com/files/2074088/uploaded/legswall.jpg); [Supportive Child&#8217;s Pose](http://dorestorativeyoga.com/images/supported_childs1.jpg); [Supported Twist](http://www.restorativeyogaposes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/25.jpg); [Instant Maui](http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/c0.0.403.403/p403x403/564661_473413886026658_1194564928_n.jpg); and [Savasana](http://www.anamayaresort.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/savasana-hillaryrubin21.jpg) are just a few you can do. Hold these poses for at least 10 minutes each. [This video](http://running.competitor.com/2012/09/videos/video-restorative-yoga-for-recovery_18017) shows some poses.
