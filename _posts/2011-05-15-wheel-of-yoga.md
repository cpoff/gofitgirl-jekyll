I skipped my Sunday Vinyasa Yoga class today to have brunch with Curt and some friends. We had a good time and delicious food.  
Since I didn&#8217;t go to yoga today I wanted to do something that counted toward exercise. I would have probably skipped entirely, but I didn&#8217;t exercise on Tuesday because of a work dinner.  
I recently purchased the Wheel of Yoga DVD, which I saw at the yoga studio.

It is about a 45 minute workout before you go on a ride and about 15 minute stretching after your ride. I did both parts of the DVD. It wasn&#8217;t vigorous, but it was good.  
I understand the importance of stretching before and after exercise. But most people don&#8217;t have time to exercise for that long. I usually exercise for two hours on Saturdays and an hour and a half on Sundays. But during the week I usually have about an hour to get my exercise in.  
I was reading the back of the DVD and saw that one of my yoga teachers wrote a review on the DVD. I like Baxter and trust him.  
I don&#8217;t work out at home very often. But when I do a I like to have some options. I have a few DVDs, my [mini stair stepper](http://www.amazon.com/Mini-Stepper-Resistance-Bands-Exerciser/dp/tags-on-product/B001IIWG6Y) and [Exercise TV](http://www.exercisetv.tv/).
