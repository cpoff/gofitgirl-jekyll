Yesterday while 2-hole punching some paperwork to file into the patent files I noticed that every time I hit the lever on the hole puncher I would engage my abs.  
I never noticed that until yesterday. I mean, I could be volunteering to hole punch everyone&#8217;s paperwork at the company and have washboard abs.  
Do you think I should do an instructional video?
