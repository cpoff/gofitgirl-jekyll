When I first started working out almost three years ago I started walking. I walked at least three times a week for a month.  
Then I decided I needed to be a runner. Running is easy cardio and you can do it anywhere. You just need your tennies and preferably some workout clothes (which don&#8217;t take up much room whether you throw them in a bag and take to work or go on vacation and pack).  
I did the run/walk thing for about a week and a half or so. And then I hurt my knee. I rehabed myself and then wondered why I was running. I hate running. I had been working out at the little gym in my work building&#8211;which isn&#8217;t a bad gym. Soon after that I joined my current gym and mostly take classes, whick keep me working hard and motivated.  
Anyway, so the point of my story was &#8230; while we were in San Diego I did walk a good amount one day. But that was the most exercise I got. I watched joggers and runners whiz by on the boardwalk in front of our hotel room and it made me wish I was out there, too &#8230; enjoying the ocean, sand and weather while getting my exercise.  
Maybe someday &#8230;
