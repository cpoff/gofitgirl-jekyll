I owe a lot of my weight loss two years ago to a Weight Watchers recipe of garden vegetable soup.  
Because of upcoming parties, a wedding, holidays, etc. I fear that my oh so close to goal weight is gonna go in the other other direction, especially with work getting ready to gear up even more than it has been lately and I think visits to the gym won&#8217;t be as frequent.  
I got to the grocery today and realized I had forgotten to look up the recipe. I figured I would remember most of it. I got the basics&#8211;but basically I created my own veggie soup. Really you can add any non-starchy veggies to broth and get the same results.  
I sprayed Pam into a pot and satueed carrots, garlic and a red onion.  
Then I added three cans of 100% fat free vegetable broth to the pot.  
I then added green beans, celery, red pepper, a poblano chili from the garden, a Hungarian pepper from teh garden (which is spicy), green onions and 2-3 tbsp. of tomato paste and let simmer for 30-45 minutes. Once the green beans could be easily bitten into I knew the soup was ready.  
I added a little sprinkle of salt and pepper and a few dashes of Tapatio. I have to say I think I like this soup better than the recipe I used before.
