One of my long-time friends and readers mentioned that jumping rope or jumping in a moon bouncer is difficult &#8230; post child birth without &#8230; err &#8230; umm &#8230; peeing your pants.  
Since I don&#8217;t plan to have children luckily for me I won&#8217;t experience this.  
But she brought up Kegel exercises.  
And what the hell, I decided to do a post about it.  
And the stuff I found online, uh, wow!  
Wait, does everyone know what Kegel exercises are?  
If you get embarrassed easily, you should stop reading now.  
OK, you were warned.  
[According to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegel_exercise), in 1948 Arnold Kegel published information on pelvic floor exercise (Kegel exercise), which consists of repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the pelvic floor, now sometimes colloquially referred to as the &#8220;Kegel muscles.&#8221;  
Did you know you can buy an exercise device for this? Check out the [Super Kegel&#8217;s Exerciser](http://www.wdrake.com/walterdrake/displayitem.aspx?id=310579&cmp=compare_shop&SourceCode=20509000001&CAWELAID=1412376971&catargetid=1553566508&cagpspn=pla).  
I don&#8217;t need no stinkin&#8217; exerciser. I can do them myself, in fact I am doing them as I write this right now.  
Many women joke about Kegels (the way they are usually referred). But sometimes they can be important for some serious issues.  
[The Mayo Clinic has a how-to guide](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/kegel-exercises/WO00119) for your reading pleasure and says, Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which support the uterus, bladder, small intestine and rectum. You can do Kegel exercises, also known as pelvic floor muscle training, discreetly just about anytime. Try them at every stop light.  
[According to WebMD](http://women.webmd.com/tc/kegel-exercises-topic-overview), doctors often prescribe Kegel exercises for people who have bladder control problems (urinary incontinence). Kegel exercises are also called pelvic floor exercises because they treat and prevent pelvic floor weakness.  
In yoga practice there are times when we focus on the pelvic floor muscles with Asvini Mudra and Mula Bandha. According to Yoga Journal article titled [Mula Bandha in Action](http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2417), the bandhas are mechanisms by which a yogi can direct the flow of [prana](http://blogs.yogajournal.com/alchemy/2013/07/12/a-fire-in-your-belly/), the universal life-force energy that animates and unites us all.  
Another reader of GFG! asked for a Kegel challenge, because as she stated: Since it is a major component of female health (and male, actually), I’d like to see a Kegel challenge. Uterine prolapse and other unpleasant complications can result from not working this muscle enough, and yet it’s a hard one to think about/find time for. There are various exercises that really help a lot!  
Maybe when I start up the Monthly Challenges again we can try Kegels?
