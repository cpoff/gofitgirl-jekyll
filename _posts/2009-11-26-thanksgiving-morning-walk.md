I had to pick up a few things at the grocery today. So I decided to walk.  
It was a nice, quiet walk. Just listening to my iPhone.  
The gym is closed today. And I figure when we get home this evening from my dad and Hilda&#8217;s I am not gonna feel like working out with my own yoga or the little stair climber I have.  
I think I am gonna have a cup of m[y garden veggie soup](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3261) before we head to Dad to Hilda&#8217;s. That way I won&#8217;t be starving and gorge on all that food. I am sure I will still eat too much. But hopefully I won&#8217;t go nuts. But if my dad has that dressing he made last year &#8230; I am in trouble.
