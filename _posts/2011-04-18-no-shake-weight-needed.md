On Yahoo this evening I saw an article on four exercises that can [help a woman get sleek, toned arms](http://health.yahoo.net/rodale/WH/get-sleek-toned-arms).  
In my Saturday body conditioning classes we usually do three out of the four listed.  
You could do these exercises at the gym or even at home. You just need a pair of dumbells.  
The fourth exercise listed: Lying triceps extension can be done standing if a bench isn&#8217;t available. But a [stability ball](http://www.amazon.com/TKO-Anti-Burst-Fitness-Ball/dp/B000FH2W54/ref=sr_1_4?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1303185025&sr=1-4) can be used as well as a [Bosu Ball](http://www.amazon.com/Fitness-Quest-Bosu-Ball/dp/B0014U4ER0).
