Yesterday in body conditioning we did a lot of squat and lunge work. I hate doing that stuff. But it is also the work I need most. We did [walking lunges](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbnW3RTLEvs) and [squats with kickback](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RYha5B17tU).  
I don&#8217;t know if it was the combo of the two or the evil squats with kickback but my booty was feeling slightly sore last night. Oh man, today, ouchie!  
I went to yoga this morning and luckily we did some great stretches for the butt (and other body parts as well). We did a lot of high lunge work (picture to the left).  
We also did a great high lunge twist&#8211;which actually felt great for the sore butt muscles.  
Right before class today I was experiencing some intense cramps. I asked Ashley if there were any poses I should avoid. She told me most poses were OK and the more I moved the best it would be for my cramps. She told me if any inversions made me feel dizzy to come down.  
I made sure to definitely move today but to also listen to my body and rest when needed. I practiced [Child&#8217;s pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/media/originals/HP_220_Balasana_248.jpg) more than I normally do in a class. But felt good for my abdomen and for my sore butt muscles as well.  
I looked up some good poses to help relieve menstrual cramps. I found a variety of recommended poses, such as Child&#8217;s pose, [wide squat](http://www.fitsugar.com/Wide-Squat-Yoga-Pose-948666), [Camel pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/688), [Hero pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/490) and [Pigeon pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/863).
