    Part of my lunch yesterday consisted of Caesar salad and kidney bean salad. I was excited that the first salad had anchovies available.

When you stay at an all-inclusive resort for a week that means you pretty much get all the food and drinks you can consume.  
As I have stated in the past (many times) when I am on vacation I enjoy myself. I don&#8217;t worry about what I am eating and drinking.  
And I know once I return home I will get back on the healthy wagon.  
But that being said if someone wanted to eat healthy while at [Turks and Caicos Club Med](http://www.clubmed.us/cm/resort-turkoise-turks-caicos_p-115-l-US-v-TURC-ac-vh.html) (and I am sure any Club Med) you can still maintain a healthy lifestyle.  
The buffet for every meal is full of healthy options.  
For breakfast there is fruit, cereal and yogurt. And you could still have an egg or two, cooked to your liking.  
For lunch and dinner various salads and fruit are available. There is usually some sort of fish to eat as well.  
Every night has a theme. Last night was conch, which is a number of different medium to large-sized sea snails or their shells, [according to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conch). The night before Asian, so there was sushi. You get the picture.  
The bars are open from 9:30 a.m. to 2 a.m. Water is free flowing and encouraged every where you go. But it can be easy to forget the water and just drink all the free booze you can.  
I carry my own water bottle and many of the water fountains are designed to easily fill water bottles.  
OK, I should probably go drink so more water before I head out into the heat and sun.
