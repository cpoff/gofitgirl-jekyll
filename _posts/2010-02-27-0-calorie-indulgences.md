My dad, Michael, writes a blog for the San Francisco Chronicle, which I have mentioned before. Check out [his post about no calorie indulgences](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/mchihak/detail?blogid=185&entry_id=57852) while in the baking portion of his schooling.  
Did you read it? OK, so you can really only look at that yummy goodness to keep it at 0 calories. But that stuff looks good, doesn&#8217;t it?  
I indulged today. After my hair appointment, which followed two hours at the gym, I stopped at [Bittersweet](http://www.bittersweetcafe.com/) to get a Salted Caramel Hot Cocoa. I had no intention of getting anything from Bittersweet &#8230; but the sign outside the shop advertising this yummy hot cocoa had me walking in, ordering and paying. And I figured my hard work at the gym this morning earned the drink.
