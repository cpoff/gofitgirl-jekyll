Tuesday, June 21 is Summer Solstice.  
There will be a huge celebration at Pioneer Square, Portland from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.  
Yoga Day Portland is for everyone. Its a great opportunity to try yoga for the first time, restart your practice, get inspired to go deeper while celebrating the first official day of summer.  
Everyone is welcome to come and celebrate the benefits of yoga and community coming together for peace-within & peace-without.  
The free event will include: all-levels yoga classes, giveaways, workshops, meditation tent, kids yoga and crafts, healthy food and snacks, yoga fashion show, music, dance party, etc.  
I will be in the Yoga Athleta Fashion show at 11:45 a.m.
