I have for years. When I was in my early 20s I went to the doctor because of my bad posture and almost constant aching pain in my lower back.  
My doctor sent me to an orthopedic surgeon who told me that I have a mild form of [kyphosis](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/kyphosis/DS00681). The simple way to explain: I have slight scoliosis.  
I went to physical therapy and most of my back pain has disappeared. I still have it at times. But nowhere near as painful as it was more than 10 years ago.  
The past week or two my middle to upper back has been sore. But not really back pain. More like sore muscles. Maybe because I am trying to do more weights and abs? Not really sure.  
Yesterday in yoga we did [bridge pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/472). We also had the option to do [wheel](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/473), which I can do, but I decided to stick with bridge two of the three times we inverted. The third time I went with a [supported bridge pose](http://dorestorativeyoga.com/images/supported_bridge_block1.jpg), which is pictured above and provided by Do Restorative Yoga. Wow, who knew how healing that would be for my back.  
Today in my abs class I skipped the variations of plank we did and went for another supported bridge pose. My back had been a little tweaky and after supporting my back it felt so much better.
