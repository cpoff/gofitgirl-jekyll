I probably should have posted this sooner. But oh well, I didn&#8217;t.  
Oh, first, Happy Halloween!  
You know that dreaded Halloween candy you have to keep in your house before the trick-or-treaters come &#8230; I bought our candy about a week and a half ago and am proud to say I haven&#8217;t touched one piece.  
I was able to find two good-sized bags with almost no candy I like. One does have some Reese&#8217;s Peanut Butter Cups, which are my absolute fave. And I could eat a Tootsie Roll or two or three &#8230;  
But for some reason I haven&#8217;t been tempted. I think I know once I start I won&#8217;t be able to stop. And I am back in weight loss mode and am determined to get there.  
Another way to not eat the candy is &#8230; don&#8217;t buy any. Crazy concept, eh?  
We give out candy and glow-in-the-dark bracelets, which the neighbors seemed to have stolen my awesome idea last year. But whatever, the kids like having multiple bracelets in multiple colors.  
We also have other items for kids who can&#8217;t eat candy and have our sign ready in support of the [Trick-or-Treat Project by the CLU Campaign](http://www.clucampaign.org/projects/halloween/). There are many fun items you can have that kids will get a kick out of.  
The first year we gave out the glow-in-the-dark bracelets the kids were so excited about them. They still are, we are just no longer the one and only house that gives them out. Hrmph!  
So maybe next year don&#8217;t buy the candy and instead buy tubes of the bracelets (15 in a pack) from Michaels for $1-$2. Kids love stickers and Halloween pencils and spider rings and tattoos and bubbles. The Â options are endless.  
OK, so this year you still have a bunch of candy left over after your trick-or-treaters visited. I mean, you have to buy a lot, right? You don&#8217;t want to run out! You can&#8217;t be the dud house on the block that gets egged and TP&#8217;d.  
Take that candy to work. Co-workers love candy and especially free candy. I keep a candy bowl on my desk at work&#8211;so that is where the majority of my candy will go. There is also an area where my team sits that free food can be displayed and eaten by others.
