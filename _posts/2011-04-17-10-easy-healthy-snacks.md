On the back of the Ziploc® brand containers I noticed a list of healthy snacks, all about 100 calories or less:  
1 orange  
28 grapes  
1 3/4 cups whole strawberries  
1 small baked potato with a 1/2 cup of salsa and 2 tablespoons of fat free sour cream  
1 3/4 cups cantalope  
1 3/4 cups raspberries  
1 3/4 cups popcorn  
1/2 mini bagel and 1 oz. smoked salmon  
1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese, plus 5 strawberries
