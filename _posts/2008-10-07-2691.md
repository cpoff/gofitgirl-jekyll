This evening I headed to the grocery store after work. One of my least favorite tasks. And as I walked through the aisle containing salad dressing I noticed these great little packets.  
I am a huge fan of the [spritzers](http://www.wish-bone.com/Dressings/1807/Balsamic-Breeze-Vinaigrette.aspx), which are great for home and at the office. But not so great for the purse.  
Thought I would share my good find with you. I believe there were three flavors total.
