    Ananda Balasana (Happy Baby Pose) is a favorite of many. But not for me. I struggle in this pose as I feel like a T-Rex with my short arms and long torso. I use a block under my head to help eliminate the tilt of my head and major stretch in my neck.

We haven&#8217;t had a Comment Contest Tuesday in some time.  
I need your help.  
I am nearing the end of my teaching stint at Alameda Athletic Club.  
I have decided for my last two weeks of classes I am going to ask for student (and GFG! reader) input.  
It&#8217;s pretty easy.  
Tell me your favorite yoga pose.  
Tell me your least favorite yoga pose.  
You can definitely have more than one of each.  
If you&#8217;ve never practiced yoga or are new and don&#8217;t know a lot of the poses and/or the names you can still participate. Check out the [yoga for beginners on the Yoga Journal website](http://www.yogajournal.com/category/beginners/) for some ideas.

    Ardha Uttanasana (Half Forward Pose) feels so good for my lower back.

When I write a sequence I try to have a well-rounded yoga practice of standing poses, seated poses, balance, challenging and easier poses, twists, etc.  
I also make sure there are poses I truly enjoy and others I would really rather not do. The sequence I teach for the week is the sequence I practice at home for the week.  
I am starting to ask my students what are their favorite poses and what are their least favorite poses to give me ideas for my last few classes at the gym at the end of this month.  
For every pose you add to the comments you will have your name put in a random drawing. Each pose must be entered as a single comment to get your name thrown into the drawing more than once.  
So the more times you comment the more times your name gets thrown into the random drawing. You can comment as many times as you want to increase your chances of having your name picked.  
Comments must be made below. They won&#8217;t count via Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, etc.  
This contest starts today, Tuesday, Dec. 9 and ends Friday, Dec. 19 at noon my time (Pacific).
