    My veggie-infused dinner Monday night: steamed spinach, boiled carrots and shrimp and zucchini sauteed in Pam, garlic and New Orleans Cajun seasoning.

Monday I talked about my munchie-infused snacky day. I mentioned my high-veggie dinner and neighbor/friend/GFG! reader Jessie wanted to know more about my dinner.  
So let&#8217;s talk veggies (and, of course, I will have to get a shout out to protein … Why? Because I am on a protein kick and protein is good for you and keeps you full.)  
My Monday night dinner consisted of steamed spinach, boiled carrots and shrimp and zucchini sautéed in garlic and other seasonings  
According to [Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/433462-how-much-protein-is-in-shrimp/), a 3-ounce serving of shrimp has 11.6 grams of protein.  
There are very few veggies I won&#8217;t eat or at least try.  
I used to not be a fan of zucchini and now I love it.  
On Monday I cut it up into little pieces sautéed in Pam and garlic with New Orleans Cajun seasoning. Spicy and delicious and most important, filing.  
Note: My usual serving of brown rice with a meal is one cup. According to the website, [How Much Protein](http://www.howmuchprotein.com/foods/rice/), a half a cup (100 grams) of brown rice has almost 7 grams of protein.  
Here are some of my regular veggie-infused meals and/or sides:

  * Zucchini &#8220;pasta&#8221; sautéed and mixed with brown rice (I use a veggie peeler to make the zucchini into &#8220;pasta&#8221; and sauté with garlic, Pam and whatever seasonings you like [I like salt, pepper and Kickin&#8217; Chicken] I also throw the cooked rice in with the veggies once they are cooked and sauté it all together.)
  * Steamed eggplant, which I steam in the rice cooker, mixed with 2 tablespoons of Kung Pao Sauce, which you can get at the grocery, and seasonings. I am a HUGE fan of garlic, Kickin&#8217; Chicken and crushed pepper.
  * Boiled cauliflower, which looks like mashed potatoes in the end, and once mixed with Frank&#8217;s Buffalo hot sauce and some crushed pepper tastes amazing. To go along with my mashed &#8220;potatoes&#8221; I usually microwave a [Spicy Black Bean Burger from Morningstar](http://www.morningstarfarms.com/products/burgers.html), which is a great source of … what? … protein!
  * Grape tomatoes sautéed in Pam and garlic, salt and pepper and mixed with whole wheat penne pasta. Once the pasta is cooked I throw it in with the tomatoes and brown the pasta.
  * Mixed salad greens and spinach in bags are great. I regularly buy them. I mix half of each for a side salad and toss with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
  * If I am making a salad at home for a meal I do the half and half of greens and add: 1/4 cup bleu cheese, 1/4 cup kidney beans, 1/4 cup garbanzo beans, and either 1/4 cup of tuna or a hard-boiled egg and toss with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
  * I love potatoes. But I have to be careful with them. Because yes, they are a veggie. But they also have starch. I cut up about six little red potatoes and sauté with [Morning Star Crumbles](http://www.morningstarfarms.com/morningstar-farms-meal-starters-grillers-recipe-crumbles.html).  I just recently discovered these and love them. Once cooked and mixed well together I dab some Rooster sauce and it is delicious!
