Please be safe and stay warm.  
Only drive if you absolutely have to.  
The best way to keep updated with the status of my classes is to visit: gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/.  
That will be the most up-to-date place to find out if classes have been canceled.  
(I anticipate many cancellations.)  
Hip openers were planned for this week&#8217;s yoga sequence. Don&#8217;t worry, hips will still happen &#8230; next month.
