Tonight for dinner I made one of the recipes from the Lifetime TV show [Cook Yourself Thin](http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/shows/cook-yourself-thin).  
I made the [Easy Herb-Roasted Chicken With Roasted Veggies](http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/shows/cook-yourself-thin/recipes/easy-herb-roasted-chicken-with-roasted-veggies). I altered the veggies slightly.  
I have to say it was really good and filing. Though this wouldn&#8217;t be the normal thing I would make for dinner on a week night. I just don&#8217;t have time for that. Especially these days with working long hours and also making sure I get my gym time in, which gets much more difficult with long work hours.  
I would like to try a recipe from Cook Yourself Thin or [Hungry Girl](http://www.hungry-girl.com/) at least once a week, likely Sundays&#8211;because I will have the time to cook and experiment.
