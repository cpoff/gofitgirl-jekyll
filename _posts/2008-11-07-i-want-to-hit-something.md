Had another sub in kickboxing last night. Though I think she is taking the class over for at least the end of the year.  
Don&#8217;t get me wrong. It was a good workout. But we never got to actually hit anything or kick anything, just the air. And sometimes I need to work my frustrations out on more than the air.  
And there were a lot of combos, which I am not that great with.  
The class was good. But I like Aaron better. And Aaron&#8217;s class was definitely a lot harder.  
Oh, and she never even told us her name.
