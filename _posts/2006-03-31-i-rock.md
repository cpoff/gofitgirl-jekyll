So for the month of March I worked out (with Maya in [Yourself!Fitness](http://www.yourselffitness.com)) or walked 27 times this month!  
  
I dedicated to workout 4 times a week and walk at least twice a week for the whole month of  
March and I did it.  
There were days I really didn&#8217;t want to workout. But I remembered my commitment. With the Yourself!Fitness if I don&#8217;t feel like doing a more cardio-induced workout I go to the meditation garden and do a 15- to 20-minute yoga workout with Maya.  
And the &#8220;Walking Club&#8221; at Onyx has proved to be a motivator. There are two of us who walk regulary (twice a week) and we get others once in awhile. But we have had a third join us and stay dedicated.  
We were gonna do a bonus walk today, but it was raining. Booo!  
  
Oh, and I have shed some pounds. Woo-hoo! Go me!!!!
