    A variety mints I have been testing out.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">In October I went to see an oral surgeon about issues I was having with my jaw. I have </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/features/tmj-treatment-options">TMJ disorder</a> <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">and possibly a more serious issue going on in my jaw. (I haven&#8217;t been fully diagnosed yet.)</span>  
One of the first things he told me was that I had to stop chewing gum. Wow, that was some tough news to hear.  
I am a gum chewer and have chewed gum for as long as I can remember. I like it for fresh breath, but especially for the fact that it helps prevent me from snacking.  
It&#8217;s been a little more than three months since I stopped chewing gum. And now I rarely miss it. (Though there are occasions when I want a piece.)  
I have also flown three times since I gave up gum. My ears pop a lot and sometimes I get pain in my jaw and forehead and the gum can help. But so far I have done OK without chewing gum during take off and landing.  
I have been trying out different types of mints for my gum replacement.  
I have tried Tic Tac Freshmints,which are small and easy to carry. And they remind me of when my mom used to carry them in her purse when I was a kid.  
I have tried two kinds of BreathSavers mints. I didn&#8217;t realize I had bought the same brand because they are different flavors and come in completely different packaging.  
The sugar-free BreathSavers 3-Hour Spearmint are my favorite of the recent tries. They are rather tasty. The only negative so far is that container only holds 30 mints. And the fact that they are super tasty I want to keep popping them in my mouth.  
They claim that the mints are long lasting and have been clinically proven to reduce intrinsic bad breath for up to three hours. I am not sure if that is true. But my breath does feel fresh for some time after the mint is long gone.  
They are a great alternative to my gum chewing. I wish they came in a bigger package as I go through a 30 pack pretty quickly.  
To my initial disappointment I accidentally grabbed IceBreakers spearmint mints the other day at the grocery thinking they were BreathSavers spearmint. But these are pretty good, too. And the mints are smaller &#8230; so the hope is that the pack will last me longer. We&#8217;ll see.  
And the best part is the &#8220;to share&#8221; and &#8220;not to share&#8221; sides of the pack.

    The mints overall get 4 1/2 dumbbells. But this review is really on the BreathSavers 3-Hour Spearmint, which are my favorite so far. They are super tasty, easy to carry in your purse and give you fresh breath.
