of trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle when it comes to making good food choices and staying active with exercise.  
Last week was a crazy week at work with packing. I did go to the gym all three days of my weekend. Then back to work and a crazy week of unpacking and reorganizing and then out of town for the weekend.  
I am hoping to get back on track once again on Monday.  
We can only do our best. But I still feel guilty. Especially with the poor food choices. Oh well.
