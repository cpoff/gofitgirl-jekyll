So Curt sent me [this link](http://www.baskinrobbins.com/Nutrition/product.aspx?Category=Beverages&id=BV228) and I nearly fell out of my chair in shock.  
You have to check out the nutritional information for yourself for full shock value.  
This shocker teaches us a good lesson about really being aware of what you are putting in your mouth.  
I decided to see what the nutritional information was for the small. Even that is shocking at 990 calories and 46 grams of fat.  
When I was 15 I worked at Baskin Robbins. And I ate a lot of ice cream. I also didn&#8217;t even weigh 100 pounds when I worked there. In my 8 or 9 months of working there about 3 nights a week I gained about 5 pounds.
