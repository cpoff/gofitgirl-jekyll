    It&#8217;s December 1 and the countdown begins to Christmas day&#8211;a little more than three weeks away.

Well, we have been launched into a month of crazy. Yup, it&#8217;s December 1.  
And that means parties, stress, overeating, gatherings, over drinking, standing in long line, baking, cooking, shopping, mailing &#8230;  
During this month of nuts-O we need to remind ourselves to take a breath and relax (when we can).  
It&#8217;s important to try to keep our healthy lifestyles this month. And that can be challenging and difficult.  
**Healthy choices:** So for GFG&#8217;s December Monthly Challenge make **ONE** healthy choice every single day this month.  
If you can do a whole day of healthy I say go for it.  
And of you fail one day, one week or the whole month don&#8217;t be so hard on yourself. You can always give it another go.  
I took a Restorative Yoga workshop yesterday with one of my favorite people and teachers. I believe [Restorative Yoga](http://www.restorativeyogateachers.com) is important for all of us to take the time to slow down, rest and take care of ourselves.  
Vickie gave us a 31-day challenge (for the month of December) to commit to 15 minutes of [Savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/corpse-pose/) each day, which can be easily described as conscious relaxation.  
[Supported Savasana](http://static.squarespace.com/static/51f880c6e4b06e4fa4f5ffa4/5210c883e4b0c36e7d263145/52e5bcdee4b07d330249b92a/1415230041886/Savasana_artistic.jpg?format=1000w) is even yummier. It&#8217;s nice if you have yoga props. But you can do this pose with a folded blanket under your head and and rolled blanket under your knees.  
[In this video, Vickie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gHm9mD41dg) talks about the importance of practicing Restorative Yoga.  
Taking on conscious relaxation for 15 minutes a day can be your one healthy choice for the day.  
**Charity:** I try to be charitable all year long, but December seems to be a good time to make it part of the Monthly Challenge as well.  
And recently I have noticed so many more people standing on street corners asking for money.  
I have made it a habit to hand out coffee cards to people asking for money than actual money. I know that they can get something warm (or cold if the weather is hot) to drink and something to eat.  
I also put together some Chico bags with water bottles, tuna and crackers, Cliff bars to hand out to those asking for help. I plan to keep those in the car and hand them out this month.  
There are so many charities we can give to. And I know each of us has something we are passionate about.  
The past couple of years I have played Secret Santa and paid off layaways for people who were very likely not going to be able to pay it off in time for Christmas.  
[The first time I did it](http://gofitgirl.com/2012/12/making-christmas-happier-for-3-families/) I was in Tucson for Christmas and Marilyn, my mother-in-law, went with me to share in the awesome experience.  
[Last year](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/12/secret-santa/) I made sure I made the Toys R Us deadline to pay off the layaways before they closed.  
I plan to do it again this year.  
Many stores will participate in Secret Santa. My experiences have been positive and the people you work with at the store get as much joy out of it as you do playing Santa.  
I know money may be tight and this may not be possible for some. But there are so many other ways you can contribute to others this time of year.  
It truly is a blessing to be able to help others in any way you can. Whether you donate money, time, skills, etc. It all makes a difference.  
Don&#8217;t forget to take care of yourself over this month.
