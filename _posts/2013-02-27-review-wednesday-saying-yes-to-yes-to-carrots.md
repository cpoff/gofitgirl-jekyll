    Yes to Carrots makes a variety of products: shampoo and conditioner; facial cloths; lip butters; moisturizers; eye gel; body butter, etc.

When I was running the toy drive at work in December one of my friends/co-workers gave me some Yes to samples to add to the makeup &#8220;kits&#8221; (caboodle boxes) I had put together for some of the older girls.  
I got samples of cleansers, lotions, eye gel, lip butter, etc.  
I decided to keep a few for myself to try out and then, of course, write a review for Go Fit Girl!  
I took only samples I thought my nose could handle.  
I have a high sensitivity to perfumes and smelly lotions and such, which give me what I call mini-migraines, raging headache and nausea.  
Here are the samples I grabbed and tried myself:

  * **Yes to Carrots: Deliciously Rich Body Butter** The smell was subtle. It had an earthy almost dirt smell. But it was still lingering and I wasn&#8217;t a fan. I think the &#8220;perfumey&#8221; smell was almond oil. The actual body butter was pretty amazing. Though the sample wasn&#8217;t big enough for me to give it a fair review.
  * **Yes to Tomatoes: Facial Hydrating Lotion** I could do without the perfumey smell. I love the product, just not the smell. And I wish it had SPF. Yes to does have an [SPF line](http://www.yestocarrots.com/category/yes-to-spf?category_id=0000033&nav_id=0000006), which includes moisturizers. I really loved how it made my skin feel. (Unfortunately I could not find this product on the website. Maybe it is no longer available?)
  * **Yes to Cucumbers: Soothing Eye Gel** The smell is gentle. And I love how it cools and makes the skin under my eyes feel firm and bright.
  * **Yes to Carrots Lip Butter in Mint and Citrus:** I am a huge Chapstick fan. It is a must have for me to carry lip balm at all times. The lip butters feel great on my lips. I like both the citrus and mint. But the mint gives my lips a little tingle. They probably don&#8217;t last as long on my lips as the Chapstick. But otherwise I love the feel of them. And the smell of them is perfect for me. Most of the lip butters don&#8217;t come with SPF, which is a bummer.

After trying some of the samples I decided I really liked them and wanted to buy some products. I went to the [website](http://www.yestocarrots.com/yes-brands.html) and perused and picked out a few things to purchase. I have also seen items at Target (where I purchased a few more things) and Walgreens. Apparently most drug stores sell the Yes to products.  
I ordered lip butters for myself and Comment Contest Tuesday winners. I also ordered shampoo and conditioner; facial wipes and eye gel.  
The Yes to Carrots scalp relief shampoo and conditioner are amazing. They claim they will clear up dry scalp in seven days. I don&#8217;t wash my hair every day so I haven&#8217;t actually used the product seven times &#8230; yet. But it definitely seems to be making a difference. And I love the citrus smell.  
The facial wipes and eye gel (both part of the cucumber line) have a light and agreeable smell. The facial wipes are perfect for travel or for when I hit the gym right after work and I need to remove my makeup.  
Once I decided on the items I wanted to order I put in my order on a Tuesday night. The next day I received an e-mail that one of my items was on back order. The following Tuesday I realized I hadn&#8217;t received my order. I planned to check in and forgot. Two days later I received a call asking me about my billing address being different than my shipping address. I explained that the shipping address was work. She told me if there were any issues with that they would contact me. About a week/week and a half went by and no package. I called and they told me the item on back order was holding things up. I was annoyed because that had never been relayed to me. I asked them to cancel that part of the order. The woman I dealt with on the phone had amazing customer service. And I realize it was just some sort of mix up. I finally got my items (along with some samples) &#8230; about a month after I put my order in.  
Recently I found everything I would want at Target and plan to buy my future Yes to products there.  
The Yes to products are organic with a line of natural skin and hair care.  
Part of the [Yes to Mission](http://www.yestocarrots.com/mission.html) is that they strive to make affordable kick-ass products that work and make people feel good.  
Yes to is also involved in what they call a Seed Fund, where they help feed thousands of kids by planting school gardens in the US and Africa where they create a global community of students working together toward mutual learning, teaching and understanding.  
I love their products and their mission and philanthropy ways. Except for a few yuck smells and the shipping mix up I love Yes to and recommend others to try their products out. Go to Target to buy your Yes to products and you will be satisfied.

    If there hadn&#8217;t been the shipping mix up and some of the unfortunate smells Yes to would have gotten 4 1/2 to 5 dumbbells. I absolutely love their products and mission and that they are willing to help others.
