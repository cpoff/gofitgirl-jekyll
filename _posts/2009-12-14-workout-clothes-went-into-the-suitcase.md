And never came out. In fact they may still be in my suitcase.  
I took workout clothes with me to Tucson knowing the Arizona Inn had an exercise room. And they never left the suitcase. My bathing suit did though.  
It&#8217;s the thought that counts, right?  
But I did do some dancing at the wedding. And in heels. So that counts for something.
