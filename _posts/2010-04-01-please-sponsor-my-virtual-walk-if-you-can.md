My company, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, has created a team to support the MMRF Race for Research.  
Check out my page by [clicking right here](http://321cure.themmrf.org/site/TR/RaceforResearch/General?px=1454694&pg=personal&fr_id=1110).  
I signed up for the virtual walk, since I will be on vacation that day. But I assure you, there will be much walking in London, Paris and Amsterdam.  
If you can financially support me, any donation is appreciated. If money is tight, I will take words of encouragement. Whatever you offer (be nice!) I will take.  
Thank you.
