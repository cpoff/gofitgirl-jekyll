Yesterday a co-worker/friend wanted to go to Chevys after work. We both had one drink and no chips and salsa. I had a Corona Light. My friend ordered a mango margarita, which she usually can&#8217;t finish. Normally I would finish the drink for her. But I was trying to be disciplined and not consume too many empty calories. I was proud of myself for having the strength and will power.  
Today for lunch my co-workers and I grabbed food at a place near work. You can build your own salad or sandwich. I came up with a pretty yummy sandwich recently. I decided to use my own bread (Sara Lee Delightfuls) and I just got the ingredients to put into the sandwich, which made it cheaper and healthier. I got two slices of bacon instead of my normal four. I also got one slice of Pepper Jack cheese instead of two slices. I also used a lot less chipotle mayo. (In case you want to know the sandwich, it is a fancy version of a BLT: chipotle mayo, Pepper Jack cheese, bacon, sun dried tomatoes, lettuce, regular tomatoes, possibly avocado spread and whatever bread you want. Lately I have been using focaccia bread, which is loaded with calories.)  
For my work out today I wasn&#8217;t able to attend my noon spin class because of a meeting. And I had errands and stuff to do after work. So I decided to work out in the little gym in my work building. I worked out on the stair master for about 30 minutes and then did some abs and stretching.
