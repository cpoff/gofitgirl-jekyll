Since my company moved to South San Francisco I have been trying to work from home most Fridays.  
I worked from home yesterday and was able to attend a noon spin class.  
I had to go in to work today. So I wasn&#8217;t able to attend Forrest Yoga at the studio near my house. But I was able to attend the yoga class at the gym, which I used to take rather regularly before my company moved.  
The instructor, Ken, is great and who I just found out will be eventually leaving. Bummer. He really worked our hips and thighs today. And the last part of class we do something restorative, which is always wonderful.  
Friday night yoga is always the most amazing way to end the week, especially if it has been a bad and/or rough week and it is always a lovely way to start the weekend.
