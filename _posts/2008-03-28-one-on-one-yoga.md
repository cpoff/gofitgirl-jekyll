I almost didn&#8217;t go to yoga this morning. But I thought I need to go. Get up! So I did.  
  
(Oh, and last night I finally&#8211;after months and months&#8211;went back to kickboxing. Man, it was tough. A co-worker, Kim, joined me, which made it a little easier.)  
There is this yoga sub at my gym for some reason I am not a fan of. I have started reminding myself to not let his style bother me and to just appreciate the practice.  
I knew he was subbing today. I went into class and I was the only one. It ended up being great.  
We focused on strengthening my core and stretching out my back. He asked me what I wanted to work on and we pretty much focused on my needs. Normally you would have to pay top dollar for a private yoga class.  
  
Happy Friday everyone and have a great weekend!
