Wednesday, March 8, is International Women&#8217;s Day.  
It&#8217;s also a protest/strike day: A Day Without A Woman. More information [can be found here](https://www.womensmarch.com/womensday/).  
A day for women to strike.  
I have given this day, this strike a lot of thought.  
If I were still in the corporate world I would absolutely take the day off without pay.  
But if I don&#8217;t teach (aka work) there are consequences.  
Simply put: If I don&#8217;t work I don&#8217;t get paid. And believe me, as a yoga teacher I need every penny I earn.  
And it isn&#8217;t fair to my students if I don&#8217;t teach.  
I teach two private office yoga classes on Wednesdays. My students have already paid me for these classes. So they would either not get yoga &#8230; but still pay for it &#8230; or not get yoga and I have to pay them back for that class.  
Neither option seems like a good idea to me.  
My third class on Wednesdays is a cycle class at a gym. I could get a sub. If I am not able to get a sub &#8230; I still have to teach. Plus the following Wednesday I have a sub in place as I will be going out of town.  
So I will be working but still observing this important day in other ways.  
I will be doing other things on Wednesday to support women.

  * I will be wearing read (ordered a new yoga top) to show support for women&#8217;s rights and Susan B. Anthony. (Woman’s rights activist [Susan B. Anthony wore a red shawl](http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_529597) when advocating for women’s rights at suffrage conventions, speaking engagements or congressional sessions.)
  * I won&#8217;t be spending any money on Wednesday. (Though to be completely transparent, I will have to pay for parking.)
  * I will be supporting [Rose Haven](http://rosehaven.org) with my Beaverton Huddle to support other women who need help, love, kindness, compassion, understanding and just a helping hand.

  <strong>One struggle, one fight. </strong>

  <strong>Rights and equality for all.</strong>

  <strong>Women&#8217;s right are human rights.</strong>
