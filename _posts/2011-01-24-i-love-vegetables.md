I was grocery shopping on Saturday after my two hours at the gym. I was in the produce department grabbing my various fruits and vegetables for the week for Curt and myself. I was just finished bagging up some Brussels sprouts when a woman came over to get some small red potatoes and announced to me that she loves red potatoes. I agreed with her and then announced: I love vegetables!  
And I truly do. There are very few vegetables I don&#8217;t like. The only thing off the top of my head that I am not fond of is zucchini. Some of my friends shared a zucchini &#8220;pasta&#8221; recipe with me last year. And I have to say I like it that way. And have been making that pretty regularly.  
The great thing about vegetables is they are good for you, fill you up and contain all sorts of healthy things.  
I recently bought a rice cooker and it came with a steamer. So tonight I made a week&#8217;s worth of brown rice and steamed the Brussels sprouts. One time I accidentally cooked the sprouts too long and they were mushy. But I have to say I really like them that way. So I purposely did that tonight. Then I squished them together with the brown rice and garlic, Kickin Chicken and salt and pepper. Yum.
