I attended the noon spin class today at the gym. Sometimes it is difficult to get to the gym in the middle of the day. But once I am there and especially after class I feel great.  
The Thursday evening class is now at 5:30&#8211;which is a little difficult for me to get to. A kickboxing class has started (or maybe it has already started) up again at 7 p.m. on Thursdays. I may try that class in a few weeks&#8211;give myself some variety&#8211;spin, Zumba, kickboxing, yoga, etc.  
The whole month of July has been a challenge in the exercise and caloric intake departments. But so far I have made it to the gym at least four times in a week. Not too bad. I don&#8217;t even want to think about what I have been eating.
