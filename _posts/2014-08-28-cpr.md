    My friend who let me practice CPR and AED administration.  And he let me work out that lodged piece of food he was choking on.

In order to be able to sub/teach classes at the gym where I am a member they require you be CPR certified.  
I recently took a CPR class with [Safety Training Seminars](http://www.berkeleycprclasses.com) (American Heart Association).  
I am now CPR/AED certified.  
I learned how to administer CPR to an adult, child and infant. I also learned how to use an AED (<span style="color: #000000;">automated external defibrillation).</span>  
CPR stands for <span style="color: #000000;">cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</span>  
I also learned how to help an adult, child, pregnant woman and infant if they are choking.  
I took this certification class because it was a requirement for me to start subbing at my gym (and possibly other places I may teach).  
But I also think this is good knowledge to have just in case. I would rather no one I know stop breathing or start choking. But if you do, I have the skills to help you.  
Is the scene safe? &#8230;
