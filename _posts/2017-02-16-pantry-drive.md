    During the Huddle on Thursday, Feb. 9 I am talking about something &#8230;
  </p>
</div>

  
I mentioned in an [earlier post](http://gofitgirl.com/2017/02/food-pantry-drive/) about being part of a Beaverton Huddle.  
We met for the first time Thursday, Feb. 9 as part of the Women&#8217;s March 10 actions in the first 100 days.  
The idea of the Huddles all over the nation (and possibly the world) was to gather with others to define our next steps, and envision how to transform the energy we saw at [Women’s Marches](https://www.womensmarch.com/) into local and national action.  
Many things and ideas were discussed. We talked about how we were feeling. And that we want to take some sort of action. It was a really beautiful and empowering experience. An amazing way to continue our work as peaceful and loving activists.  
A few things that were said during the meeting:

  * Our work isn&#8217;t done
  * We are in a space where crazy is possible
  * Any legitimate religion is about love
  * (We want) real knowledge (about certain subjects&#8211;such as redistricting)
  * We stood up &#8230; We spoke up &#8230; We follow up
  * (We want to live in a world) where kindness is seen as true strength

Friday, Feb. 17 is The General National Strike Day, which calls for no work and no commerce.  
No work isn&#8217;t a possibility for me. As with some other women in my Beaverton Huddle group.  
So we came up with an idea to do good that day, whether you work or not.  
One of the women in the group works at the [Disability, Aging and Veteran Services](http://www.co.washington.or.us/HHS/DAVS/) in Washington County, Oregon. We decided as a group to help resupply their pantry as supplies are low.

Items can be dropped off at [Solace & Fine Espresso](https://www.instagram.com/solace.fineespresso/) in Beaverton (4655 SW Griffith Drive) all day Friday, Feb. 17 (updated information from my previous post) as a bin will be provided. The bin will be attended from 6:30-8:30 p.m.  
I am really excited about this food pantry drive. When I was in the corporate world I ran the yearly food drive and toy drive for about seven years. I loved doing it. I felt good about myself, my company, our community, the organizations I worked with.  
If you are in the Beaverton area and want to participate there&#8217;s still time. If you want to host your own drive, do it. Or maybe you have passion for another organization that needs time, money or supplies. Organize something.  
Making the world a better place can be so easy. We can all just do a little something to make it brighter and better.
