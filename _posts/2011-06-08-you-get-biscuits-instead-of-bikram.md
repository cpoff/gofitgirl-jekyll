I was planning on doing a post on Bikram Yoga. But I have been busy tonight and it is almost 9:30, which is sadly about my bedtime. I get up at 5 during the week so I like to try to be in bed by 9:30 and be asleep by 10. But just for you, dear readers, I am sacrificing a little bit of sleep. (And enough sleep is so important to me. I am kinda crabby if I don&#8217;t get enough.)  
In my brief research on Bikram, I found an interesting article titled, [Can Hot Yoga Help to Lose Weight Faster?](http://munfitnessblog.com/can-hot-yoga-help-to-lose-weight-faster/) I was pretty sure the answer was no. I do plan to do more extensive research for a future post. So stay tuned.  
My mom and stepdad are coming in to town tomorrow. They are going to cat/housesit while Curt and I are on vacation. Fred wanted to have a ham delivered to us for us all to enjoy from [Burgers&#8217; Smokehouse](http://www.smokehouse.com/). Curt stuck it in the oven for us tonight to start munching. We had ham, biscuits and corn for dinner.  
When I was buying the yummy delicious Pillsbury biscuits at the grocery I noticed one with fewer calories and fat. I bought one [Simply Buttermilk](http://www.pillsbury.com/products/biscuits/simply-biscuits) biscuits, which have 100 calories and 4.5 grams of fat. (And there are 10 in the container.) I also bought one [Pillsbury Grands!](http://www.pillsbury.com/Products/Biscuits/Grands-Frozen-Biscuits), which have 180 calories and 7 grams of fat. (And there are 8 in the container.)  
We made the Simply biscuits tonight. They were a little small. But they tasted good. We both liked them. Â Not a bad trade off when you still want the taste but not the calories.
