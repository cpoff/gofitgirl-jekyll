    I have to say I am pretty bad ass at the hula hoop. Though I never know what to do with my hands &#8230;

On Wednesday and Thursday my company hosted a Wellness Fair.  
Biometrics (blood pressure, glucose, BMI, cholesterol, etc.) were taken along with consultation and advice from nurses.  
The Wellness Fair had booths from our various insurance providers, dental provider, eye care provider, Mental Health Network and for cooking demonstrations, Cross Fit and Yoga representation. And the Wellness Committee represented with a booth, which I personally thought was the best booth.  
I am part of the Wellness Committee. Our booth had a &#8220;Wheel of Fortune,&#8221; where you could spin the wheel and answer a question about health/nutrition/wellness correctly and receive a raffle ticket for a chance to win an iPad mini.  
There was a second chance to win as well with the hula hoop. Get the hoop around any body part 10 times for another entry into the drawing.  
For me hula hooping is pretty easy. I enjoy it and find it fun. I figured it had to be pretty good exercise. So, of course, that meant I had to do a little research.  
Apparently there are bonafide hula hoop routines. [This routine](http://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/workouts/hula-hoop-exercise-00000000057576/index.html) seems pretty good.  
I found a [Hoop Boot Camp routine on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAAlrrtJoWk). The term Boot Camp might be a little generous. But it looks fun and fairly easy once you get the hang of all the moves.  
There are [weighted hula hoops](http://www.sports-hoop.com/indmain_sportshoop.aspx?gclid=CNvMyoKyy7UCFUeCQgodxnsA8w) as well. [This Mayo Clinic article gives](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/weighted-hula-hoops/AN01638) them some merit but also extends to regular ol&#8217; hula hoops. Dr. Edward Laskowski says: (any) hula hoop can help you meet your exercise goals.  
[Hooping.org](http://www.hooping.org/2010/02/how-many-calories-can-i-burn-hula-hooping/) says when hula hooping one can burn about 100 calories in 10 minutes, which apparently is a scientific claim.  
So run to Target, Walmart or wherever your local hula hoops are sold, buy one (they are cheap!) and start moving those hips! Woo-hoo!
