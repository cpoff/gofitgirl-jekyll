Last Friday I started getting a chest thing and a slight cough. I was in denial and told myself it was allergies. When I woke up Saturday I knew it wasn&#8217;t allergies, it was a chest cold.  
I didn&#8217;t go to the gym. Instead I went to work and worked on some files. Once I came home I lounged while watching movies and knitting.  
Sunday morning I felt a little crappy. Did my regular grocery shopping. Curt and ran an errand and had lunch. By the time we got home I was exhausted and took a nap. The rest of the evening was lounging, movie watching and knitting. I decided that night I wouldn&#8217;t go into work the next day.  
Monday was lounging, movie watching, knitting and a little work filing. By Monday evening my chest cold became a full on cold. Tuesday was lounging, movie watching, knitting and one work call.  
When I woke up Wednesday morning I was so tired. But I had to at least show up for work for a bit. I went in for about 5 hours. Then I came home and it was lounging, movie watching and knitting. (Yes, getting a little stir crazy.)  
Today I felt even better. Went to work and worked almost a full day. Left a little before 4 p.m. And came home for some lounging, movie watching and knitting.  
I have been drinking tons of tea, sometimes spiked with a little rum.  
When I am sick I don&#8217;t bother tracking food and counting Points(r) or calories. My appetite is fine. Though besides the rum I don&#8217;t crave any other alcohol&#8211;except Nyquil. And I have been eating a lot of peanut butter. Not really sure why. I love peanut butter regardless. And I am normally a smooth peanut butter girl. But I have been getting into the crunchy.  
For lunch today I had matzo ball soup. It was really good. I will be having the same thing tomorrow.  
My congestion is getting less &#8230; congested. I still have a horrid cough. And now I have the nasty sore throat. But I am getting better and feeling a little better. Though no one would know, I sound horrible. I have the very horse (maybe sexy) voice going on.  
I am doing my best to take it easy as much as possible. I know that is what is best for me &#8230; even if I do have a ton of work to do before going on vacation in two weeks!!!! (I can&#8217;t wait!)
