Tonight in spin class it was the battle of the fan.  
I like to sit in the front row: I can see and hear the teacher better and I am closer to the fans.  
Once class heated up I got off my bike to turn on a fan. I asked the guys behind me if they wanted the smaller fan on them. They said no. So I just turned on the big tornado fan and got back on my bike.  
After about 5-10 minutes one of the guys behind me got up and turned the tornado fan. Uh, OK, now I had no cool air on me. So I asked him to turn on the little fan for me.  
Here&#8217;s the thing &#8230; you know where the fans are in class. If you don&#8217;t want a fan on you don&#8217;t sit on a bike right near them. Other people do want air on them. And the guy could have moved to a bike away from the fans.  
Hopefully I won&#8217;t endure this battle again. I seriously don&#8217;t understand how people can work out when they are so hot and sweaty. Spin is tough enough as it is. I don&#8217;t need that enhanced with being hotter than necessary.
