    During the workshop today one of the poses we did was supported Child&#8217;s Pose, which is my favorite Restorative pose.

This is what my friend Pam asked Monica and me yesterday before spin class as Monica and I were discussing the [The Gift of Restorative Yoga workshop](http://namasteoakland.com/programs/workshops/restorative) we attended today with Vickie.  
According to Namaste&#8217;s workshop link, Restorative Yoga uses props to support the body, allowing for expansiveness and ease while stimulating the body’s innate healing abilities. This workshop will enable us to explore the benefits of bringing awareness and balance to the body- mind.  
This is a direct description from Namaste&#8217;s class description of Restorative Yoga: Gentle yoga and passive restorative postures to open the body, quiet the mind and move into a deep sense of relaxation. A meditative time to cultivate awareness of body breath and mind, this class is recommended for those experiencing stress, recovering from injury or illness, and anyone seeking a gentle class to unwind, relax and renew.  
I try to practice Restorative Yoga as often as my schedule allows. It is relaxing and makes me really try to calm my mind and bring down my stress.  
Today Vickie talked about our [vata](http://www.yogajournal.com/health/1448), which according to Yoga Journal website, it governs all movement in the body and mind. (The Sanskrit translation of the word is &#8220;that which moves things.&#8221;) It enables our fluids to flow, our nerve impulses to fire, our thoughts to coalesce, and, well, our wastes to pass. In other words, vata keeps all of our systems going and contributes to great vitality.  
I [wrote about the Restorative workshop](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9699) I went to in September. I did a little more research on adrenal fatigue, which I believe I suffer from to a degree.  
I recently purchased the book [Adrenal Fatigue: The 21st Century Stress Syndrome](http://www.amazon.com/Adrenal-Fatigue-Century-Stress-Syndrome/dp/1890572152/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1355616180&sr=1-1&keywords=adrenal+fatigue). I have gotten into another book called [A Gift of Hope: Helping the Homeless](http://www.amazon.com/Gift-Hope-Helping-Homeless/dp/0345531361/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1355616327&sr=1-1&keywords=a+gift+of+hope+danielle+steel) and am totally into that book. Once I finish that I will go back to Dr. Wilson&#8217;s book. (I plan to write about A Gift of Hope soon as well. It is an easy read and a small book. I am almost finished reading it and I feel like it has changed my life.)
