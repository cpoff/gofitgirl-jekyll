I try to be an environmentally friendly person.  
We recycle, we compost, I shop with reusable bags, I rarely buy bottled water and instead have a Pur water filter on our kitchen facet where I fill up my [Camelbak water bottle](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9990) regularly.  
Late last year I became an owner of my very first Chico Bag. I now have several.

    A Chico Bag opened and all rolled up for easy storage in purse, bag, backpack, glove compartment &#8230;

The bag rolls up into itself into a small pack, which is easy to carry in a purse, backpack, glove compartment, etc. When opened up in full it becomes a good size sturdy bag. And according to the tag on the bag the Chico Bag can carry up to 25 pounds.  
I like to carry the Chico Bag in my purse for unexpected shopping trips or when I don&#8217;t have my reusable bags.  
I usually have two in my purse and have even lent a bag to a friend.  
You can find a variety of [Chico Bags in Go Fit Girl!&#8217;s Amazon store](http://astore.amazon.com/gofigi-20/). There are a variety of bags to choose from like [this one](http://astore.amazon.com/gofigi-20/detail/B00384ABOA) and [these](http://astore.amazon.com/gofigi-20/detail/B005AMQ9FS) and even [these](http://astore.amazon.com/gofigi-20/detail/B001PL6E7Q).  
Probably the only negative that I can think of is germs. That is likely the biggest concern with any reusableÂ bags.  
How do you clean a Chico Bag?  
I try to to regularly throw them in the washer. I have some bags where delicates can be stashed together and be safely washed. So I throw my bags in the [delicates bag](http://www.amazon.com/Mesh-Lingerie-Delicates-Wash-Bag/dp/B0001E83AE) and get those dirty bags clean. I don&#8217;t throw them in the dryer and just let them air dry.  
A Clorox or Lysol wipe would also work. Even old fashioned soap and water.  
According to this article, [What&#8217;s in your shopping bag? Bacteria](http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/sns-green-bacteria-in-shopping-bags,0,4837500.story), machine washing or hand washing (reusable bags) reduced bacteria levels to almost nothing. (Part of the debate over [banning plastic bags](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9870) is that they have little potential for bacterial contamination.)  
I give the Chico Bags 4 1/2 dumbbells.  
And these can be great stocking stuffers or you can use them to carry the Christmas presents to your mom&#8217;s, friend&#8217;s or wherever.
