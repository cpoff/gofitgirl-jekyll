Pretty much every Sunday I am sore from body conditioning and abs/core class on Saturdays.  
In class yesterday Jennifer had us do squats and lunges&#8211;but not as many and much slower. She said we would feel it today and she was right. My butt is so freakin&#8217; sore today. We use that [crazy bosu ball](http://www.bosu.com/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=BOSU/story.html) so we are also working on balance&#8211;which I pretty much suck at.  
I was planning on going to the gym today, which is my off day. But I didn&#8217;t go to the gym on Thursday or Friday because I had my flu shot. According to the nurse who gives us the flu shots at work that you should let your body take it easy for a couple of days . So I did take it easy&#8211;I don&#8217;t need to be getting sick right now with work just too crazy.  
But then when I woke up this morning I was sore and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym. I have been super lazy today. Sundays is my kinda rest day from the gym and I try to make it a rest day from anything else, too.
