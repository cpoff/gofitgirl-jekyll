OK, OK, I guess it is now or never. I LOVE spin and this comes from a girl who hates exercise. When I started running a few years ago I really enjoyed it, but then I started having IT band issues and could not continue running. I was bummed because I had finally found something I enjoyed.  
But, boy oh boy, running soooo does not compare to spin. I love the music, the dark room and the energy. I love that it kicks my butt almost every time. I love that I finish the class every time.  
I love that I feel like the strongest, most amazing woman in the world because I just rode 10, 12, 15 miles on my bike every time (and this is coming from a girl who doesn&#8217;t know how to ride a &#8220;real&#8221; bike. But that is a whole &#8216;nother story).  
For a while I was going to spin 2-3 times a week and I could see the muscles in my legs and butt almost immediately. One day my husband grabbed my upper thigh and gave me a look of surprise as he commented on how muscular my legs had become. Needless to say, that didn’t hurt the cause!  
Alas, that has all changed. I continued to spin for the first few months of pregnancy but it became more and more difficult to keep my heart rate at a baby-safe level (even using a heart rate monitor) so I stopped going.  
Just the other night I told my husband that I cannot wait for this kid to come so I can get back to spin class. I know, I know, that is a crazy concept especially for a non-exercise girl like myself. Hey, come to think of it, maybe they pipe something in the room or have some sort of subliminal messages in the music because it seems impossible that I would become hooked on something that makes me sweat _and_ exert energy.  
Who knows, spin class might even inspire me to learn how to ride a “real” bike one day! Check back … I might be writing a post on my cross-country bike trip or my tryout for the Tour De France!
