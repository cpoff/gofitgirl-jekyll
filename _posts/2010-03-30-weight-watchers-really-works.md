As you know I lost 30+ pounds about three years ago. I lost the first 20 pounds on counting Points(r) alone&#8211;so making better food choices and reducing my calorie/fat intake. The last 10ish pounds I lost with food and exercise.  
Probably for about two years I kept the weight off. Recently I put a little back on. My highest since losing weight was 8 pounds over my goal weight. In the past few months I have gone back and forth between eating healthy and not, counting calories and not. But the exercise has remained pretty consistent.  
Last week I started counting Points(r) again. And I am very excited to report that I am only .4 away from my goal weight. My hard work is paying off. I am proud of myself for staying on top of tracking my food and staying within healthy limits.  
I will be in good weight standing in time for a 2-week vacation to Europe near the end of this month.
