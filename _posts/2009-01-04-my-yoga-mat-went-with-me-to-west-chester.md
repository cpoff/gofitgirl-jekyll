and came home having never come out of my suitcase.  
I received a [mini stepper](http://www.target.com/InStride-Plus-Mini-Stepper-400046/dp/B000E192QS) for Christmas from Curt.  
So for the days when I am too lazy to go to the gym or when I want a little extra workout I have my mini stepper to do some cardio while watching TV. I am hoping I get to it today.  
I have gotten a lot of stuff done today: paid some bills, laundry, grocery shopping, a little relaxing. I still have to de-Christmas the house.  
Happy New Year!
