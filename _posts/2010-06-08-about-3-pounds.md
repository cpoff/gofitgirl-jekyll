The working out and tracking food is slowly working. I am about 3 pounds from my goal weight.  
Last week I hit the gym six times. And I tracked my food all week.  
I hope I can keep the discipline for the rest of this week. Next week will be tough as friends will be in town. And there will be eating out, drinking and all kinds of fun stuff, which likely will involve high calorie intake.
