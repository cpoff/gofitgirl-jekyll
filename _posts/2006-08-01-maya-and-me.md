So I actually got up about about 6 a.m. (that is early for me&#8211;even now with me being a semi-morning person) and get this &#8230; worked out!  
June there was working out at the beginning of the month. But then we were on vacation for 2 weeks, we came back and got settled into our life again. Then July started and so did my long work days. I come home exhausted from work and the last thing I want to do is work out.  
And I want to be healthy and lose weight. So I decided to buck up and get up a tad bit earlier than normal and work out. This work week will ease into it with 15-20 min. yoga workouts with Maya. Then this weekend and next work week will be the cardio again.  
Happy Tuesday!
