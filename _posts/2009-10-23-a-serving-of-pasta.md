The other night I was cooking some whole wheat pasta and needed to measure how much I was consuming. (I have been counting calories since Monday. Will write about how that is going later on.)  
The box says a serving is 2 ounces. Since I don&#8217;t have a food scale I have no idea how much that is cooked or even dry. So I finally decided to look it up. Two ounces of dry pasta is equal to 1 cup of cooked pasta. (Why I didn&#8217;t look that up sooner I don&#8217;t know.)  
The night of the pasta eating I also had enough calories in my &#8220;budget&#8221; to have a glass of wine.  
It was a good dinner with some sauteed homegrown tomatoes, a little garlic and a tsp. of olive oil over a cup of whole wheat spaghetti, a green salad with basalmic salad spritzer and a glass of red wine.
