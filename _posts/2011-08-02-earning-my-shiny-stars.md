    The July 2011 stars I earned with dedication and exercise.

Days after I got back from vacationing in Barcelona in June I started back into my exercise routine. From June 22 until July 13 I did some form of exercise. That&#8217;s 22 days in a row.  
We had friends in town so I hate a delicious dinner and drinks with them in the city on what would have been Day 23. I was &#8220;lazy&#8221; the following night and skipped yoga. The third day I was back at it and have been since. Today counts as Day No. 18 of exercise done in a row.  
For the month of July I worked out 29 of the 31 days. I am really proud of myself. I keep a calendar at work and mark each day I exercise with a star sticker. It&#8217;s a small thing&#8211;but it takes me back to being a kid and being proud to get that shiny star.  
Sometimes people will ask me what the stars on my calendar mean. When I tell them they are usually impressed.  
I am running low on star stickers so I bought some smiley stickers. I am using smileys to mark my August exercise.
