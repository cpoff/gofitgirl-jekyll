    This was from my last indoor cycling class at InShape City right before I moved to Portland.

After returning from a visit with the family in Tucson I jumped into my teaching gig at LA Fitness.  
On Wednesday night I taught a yoga class.  
Usually right before I teach a new class I get a little nervous. My students were kind and welcoming and the nerves went away rather quickly.  
I felt good about the sequence I taught them and how the class went.  
Afterward three students came up to chat with me and tell me they enjoyed the class. I received comments such as: I am going to sleep really well tonight; I liked the class because it wasn&#8217;t too gentle and it wasn&#8217;t too aggressive (I&#8217;m gonna take that as a Goldilocks and say it was just right).  
I also gave them some tips on a pose to help with insomnia. So many women I know have problems with their sleep.  
Yesterday morning I taught a cycle class. I wasn&#8217;t sure how that class was gonna go because I was using a playlist I wasn&#8217;t 100% sure of. But I know I will get in the groove with the music and playlists. As I do I will feel more

comfortable and confident.  
No one stormed out so I take that as a good sign.  
I got some thank yous and smiles at the end. One woman chatted me up after and told me she liked the class and was glad I was taking it over.  
I was also told by her and another student that my volume on the mike was perfect. They could clearly hear me and I wasn&#8217;t too loud. (Some cycle teachers scream into the microphone.)  
Next week I will be on my current full class schedule at LA Fitness. A total of five classes. Wowza!  
I am working to get in at other gyms/places as well. So keep checking [My classes page](http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/) for updates.
