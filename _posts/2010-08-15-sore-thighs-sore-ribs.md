By the time I got to the third class yesterday at the gym I had hit the wall. I felt like I barely gave it any effort.  
Apparently that was not true. I am walking like an old lady today. My thighs are killing me. My ribs are sore from the abs class. But the pain in my ribs is nothing like the pain in my thighs&#8211;going down stairs, sitting and just walking hurts.  
Spin is going to be so painful tomorrow. I just gotta push my way through it.
