    I used to be 29 will always be true. I had that shirt made for my 30th birthday. This picture was taken at my 33rd birthday party at Tootsies: pedicures, shoe shopping and chair massages with girlfriends.

Years ago I was doing a puzzle with my youngest nephew. He was and is awesome at puzzles especially at the age he was, which I think was 4 or 5. He got a difficult piece in an adult puzzle and I kinda sang, Go, Jackson. It&#8217;s your birthday. He looked at me and said, no, it&#8217;s not. So then he created his own version: It&#8217;s my birthday &#8230; not really &#8230; party anyway.  
Yes, there is a point to my post. My birthday is next month. And I want to get a new yoga mat. The one I have is kinda cheap and frankly, a little slippery, which isn&#8217;t so great when in certain poses, like [Downward Facing Dog](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/491).  
With family we don&#8217;t exchange Christmas presents as we focus on charity instead. But we still do birthday gifts, especially since it is a &#8220;special day.&#8221;Â There are only a few friends I exchange gifts with for birthdays these days.  
My mom probably already bought my gift &#8230; (and it probably has a cat on it.) ðŸ™‚ But for anyone who is actually gonna get me a gift I am asking for REI gift cards, where I plan to purchase my yoga mat.  
I would love to support the yoga studio in my neighborhood with my purchase of a yoga mat and possibly some other items. But everything is so expensive.  
The yoga mat I have now is a [Gaiam](http://www.gaiam.com/product/68+yoga+essentials+mat.do). I am thinking about getting either a [Jade](http://www.rei.com/product/786833/jade-harmony-professional-yoga-mat) or a [Manduka](http://www.rei.com/product/815256/manduka-black-mat-pro-yoga-mat). If, after my yoga mat purchase, I have any gift card left I put it toward exercise clothes&#8211;whether it be socks, tanks tops or more yoga pants. One can never have too many pairs of yoga pants.  
I am spending this weekend in Tucson and I know my dad and Hilda have multiple mats. I plan to test theirs out see if one fits me. Though from the little research I have done I am thinking for going for the [Jade](http://www.rei.com/product/786834/jade-fusion-yoga-mat) (this one is fancier and I _really_ like it).
