I hit spin today at noon. I love taking the noon spin class or the 1 p.m. yoga class during the workday. It gets me out of the office, gets my exercise in and allows me to leave work and come straight home.  
The idea is to come home at a reasonable hour. Today that didn&#8217;t quite happen. But I didn&#8217;t feel pressure at the end of my day to get out of work on time to make it to the 5:30 p.m. spin class or feel guilty about missing it.  
And today at noon my favorite spin teacher was instructing. I won&#8217;t say who that was &#8230;
