During Portland&#8217;s last snowstorm I knew I would have many classes canceled.  
We&#8217;ve had several snowstorms/ice storms since December that it&#8217;s difficult to keep track.  
But one of the more major ones in December had me going stir crazy. I knew I couldn&#8217;t just binge watch TV during another&#8211;and yes there was another and another &#8230;  
In mid-January I decided that each day I was snowed in I would film a different online yoga class.  
I did a basics yoga class, which you [can find here](https://youtu.be/jno06YF4HLE). Then I got sick and didn&#8217;t tape any more.  
I had some time on Friday to experiment with a chair yoga online class, which [can be found here](https://youtu.be/XnsGzA6oOQQ).  
Both online classes can also be found if you click [My Classes tab](http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/).  
I don&#8217;t teach gentle or chair yoga classes. But I have enough knowledge to experiment. My students range from beginner to injured to in their 20s to their 70s (sometimes I even teach kids) to very flexible to very inflexible to practicing once a week to practicing almost every day to being a yoga teacher to someone who has a regular home practice to someone who is intermediate or advanced.  
When I teach: I want students to honor their bodies. I want them to be safe (with alignment and anatomy). I want all practitioners, whatever they look like, believe, how often or how long they have practiced, or whatever their level to be able to come to my class. And to laugh a little as we practice together.  
The chair yoga sequence I put together would be great for someone new to yoga, someone looking for a gentle practice, someone with injuries or inflexibility, someone who can&#8217;t easily get up and down off the floor/mat.
