    A jump rope I used at the gym the other morning to jump for 5 minutes. Man, that wasn&#8217;t easy.

One of our exercise challenges this month in [Go Fit Girl&#8217;s April Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10354) is working the jump rope.  
If you want a major cardio workout, jump rope for 3 minutes (or longer).  
Jumping rope requires and builds coordination, is an easy and quick cardio workout and can be done almost anywhere.  
According to [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/skipping-rope-doesnt-skip-workout), jumping rope can be lower-impact exercise on knees than jogging.  
For years I have wished I was a runner. It&#8217;s easy cardio and you can do it anywhere. But I am now realizing that is the same with the jump rope. I can throw one in my suitcase. It travels easily and doesn&#8217;t take up any room.  
According to some calculations on [Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/446726-how-many-calories-do-you-burn-if-you-jump-rope-600-times/), which attributes to Mayo Clinic, I will burn about 150 calories for jumping rope 15 minutes. (The average calorie burning in a 60-minute spin class is 500 calories.)  
[This site](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Educator/FortheGym2/JumpRopeSkills/Jump-Rope-Skills_UCM_001270_Article.jsp) gives all kinds of fancy moves with the rope.  
The American Heart Association sponsors a program called [Jump Rope For Heart event](http://www.kintera.org/site/c.dkLRKbOWLjK4E/b.8180513/k.BD61/Home.htm), which provides heart research program and education.  The fundraising event helps kids learn skills to jump rope while raising money for the American Heart Association.  
What a great program. It encourages kids with a fun exercise while raising money to help other kids with heart conditions.
