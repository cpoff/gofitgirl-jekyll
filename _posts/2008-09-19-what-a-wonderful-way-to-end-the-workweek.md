I attended my regular yoga class tonight with Suraya. She is such a great and caring yoga instructor. It&#8217;s at 5:30 on Fridays. Which is great because it gets me out of work at a decent hour. But I am starting to miss the class at times because sometimes I have something planned.  
At the beginning of class we have meditation and she has us set an intention. You can also set your intention for someone else. Sometimes I do that. Tonight I set my intention for Grandma Phyllis. So I hope she was feeling my energy.  
We worked on [pigeon pose](http://yoga.about.com/od/yogaposes/a/pigeon.htm) today. It is such a great way to get your hips stretched out. I love the feeling. More and more I am getting better at the pose.  
And now I am relaxed and am ready to do some knitting and watch some TV. That is my kind of Friday night. Oh, and I made myself a bloody Mary, too.
