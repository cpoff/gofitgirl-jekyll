So once again my Mon/Wed morning yoga classes are looking for a new instructor.  
We had Sally today. She was pretty good. Though sometimes she wouldn&#8217;t tell us what we should be doing.  
Next week Sarah. And the week after that someone else.  
I have only been going to morning yoga once a week lately because Wednesdays I like to attend advanced body conditioning in the evening.  
So hopefully we will find a good replacement for the morning classes. One of my yoga friends suggested the reason many people don&#8217;t attend is because of the time. She thinks if we had class at 6:15 more people would come because many have to be at work at 8. There is no way I can get out of bed at 5:15. I mean, I can barely get out of bed at 6:15&#8211;and it is just going to get harder as it gets colder and darker.
