For my birthday my in-laws gave me an REI gift card. I plan to use it toward a [new yoga mat](http://www.rei.com/search?query=yoga+mats).I think Curt and I are going to go shopping this weekend.  
I also got some cash from Grandma so that will go toward the yoga mat or a [yoga block/brick](http://www.rei.com/search?query=yoga+block). (Before each yoga class I take a little time for me. My back has been bothering me lately. So I do a [supported bridge pose](http://dorestorativeyoga.com/images/supported_bridge_block1.jpg) before each class starts.)  
My Dad and Hilda got me a subscription to [Yoga Journal](http://www.yoga-journal-subscriptions.com/). I am looking forward to start getting the magazine.  
I also got a Nordstrom gift card from my Mom. I am debating if I should use it toward my health and wellness or just something super cute and super fun: like some awesome boots.  
When I went on to the Nordstrom web site and searched &#8220;exercise&#8221; I found some good stuff and [this](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/zella-faux-leather-trim-jacket/3170604?origin=keywordsearch&resultback=0). What the hell? Maybe if I was a wife on [The Sopranos](http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/index.html).
