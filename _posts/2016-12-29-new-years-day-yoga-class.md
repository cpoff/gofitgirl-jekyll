I am teaching a special yoga class on New Year&#8217;s Day at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/turtlesyoga/" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=330328517048503&extragetparams=%7B%22directed_target_id%22%3A0%7D" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show="1">Turtles Yoga and Wellness</a> as we step out of 2016 and transition into 2017.  
As we enter the new year we will take the time to set our intentions for the coming year.  
We will start our lovely practice by setting our intentions and a meditation, we will move through an active asana practice and end with restorative poses as we calm the body and mind.  
New Year’s <span class="text_exposed_show">Day class: 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m.</span>  
<span class="text_exposed_show">Suggested donation: $5-$10. </span>
