I did my weekly weigh-in today and dropped another 2 pounds.  
I am really proud of how well I am doing. It isn&#8217;t hard to lose&#8211;you just need the knowledge and I do have to say a little will power.  
I need to be back to a reasonable weight before heading to Europe in about five weeks. Because who knows what I will be eating while in Budapest, Prague, Vienna and parts of Germany. I highly doubt goulash is low fat. ðŸ™‚  
I want to be at a reasonable weight regardless. But it would be nice to have a few pounds to play with while on vacation.  
At least there will be a lot of walking while gone for two weeks.
