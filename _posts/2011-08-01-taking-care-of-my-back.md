Soon after I arrived at work this morning I noticed I had [mid-back pain](http://www.squidoo.com/middle-back-pain). Normally if I have back pain it is lower back pain, which is caused by a variety of things such as [Kyphosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002220/), bad posture, sitting for a long period of time, etc.  
My middle back pain was either because of a [yoga posture yesterday](http://www.ehow.com/video_2351813_chest-opener-yoga-blocks.html) (intense chest opener), sleeping oddly, stress at work &#8230; or maybe all three.  
At some point at work today I raided the first aid kit and found something called pain away. I took that and felt better for a while.

I decided to keep my workout light today. I did the above yoga stretches. After the stretches I did some light weights to stretch and strengthen my back muscles.  
I used 5 pounds for the one-arm dumbbell rows. If you can get through the annoying ad, this [video gives a great example of the one-arm row](http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-do-the-one-arm-row-with-weights).  
I also did the [two-arm row, but I did mine standing straight up, not bent over](http://www.shapefit.com/middle-back-exercises-bent-over-two-dumbbell-rows.html). I thought that would be too much for my back.  
And the third weight training I did was [lat pulldowns](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/lat-pull-down.html).  
After the three different kinds of weight training I repeated the yoga stretches.  
I didn&#8217;t rush. I just took my time. I made sure I was breathing through my moves, especially the stretches.  
Once I got on the shuttle bus to ride back to my car and home, I realized my back felt much less tweaky.
