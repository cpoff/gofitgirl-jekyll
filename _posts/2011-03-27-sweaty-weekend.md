As I blogged yesterday, I worked out for my usual two hours at the gym: spin, abs and body conditioning.  
Last night one of my fellow spin friends hosted a party at her house. There was good food, good wine and good company. Eventually it turned into a dance party. Oh man, it was so much fun. But my legs were still tired from my earlier workout. We danced the night away. It was fun but tiring and super sweaty.  
This morning I took a morning Vinyasa Yoga class. The heat in that class gets turned up slightly&#8211;between 75 and 80 degrees. But man, does it get sweaty. It was a good workout.  
My arms are pretty sore from the weights yesterday. I think the heat and the actual yoga practice helps to loosen my muscles&#8211;work through the soreness.
