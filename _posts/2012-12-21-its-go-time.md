    The good (and bad thing) about traveling by car is you can totally overpack and it is OK. (This isn&#8217;t even everything we are taking.)

The Husband and I are traveling to Tucson for Christmas &#8230; by car.  
We decided to drive as it is expensive to fly to Tucson and even more so for Christmas. We will need a car while in Tucson and for the second part of our trip to San Diego.  
I am not a huge fan of long car rides. I have some back issues and sitting for a long period of time can be quite uncomfortable for my lower back. But I think Curt will be doing the majority of the driving, which means I can shift around a little more and my back should get some relief.  
I plan to try out working on theÂ [chair yoga mini sequence](http://yogaforhealthyaging.blogspot.com/search/label/chair%20yoga%20sequence), which Baxter has recommended and wrote about on his blog (along with others) Yoga for Healthy Aging.  
So that should hopefully help with my back issues. And I am sure a few stops to stretch out my back will also help.  
My other challenge/issue is my water intake. I normally drink a lot of water. But when you drink a lot of water you also have to pee a lot. We can&#8217;t possibly stop every 30 minutes for me to take a pee break. And being from the female gender a pee stop is much more involved. And unless an emergency I pretty much refuse to pee behind a bush or in the dirt. I really need an actual toilet.  
(There is a story about when I was fairly young&#8211;2 or 3&#8211;while on a road trip with my parents. They bought me a little potty for the car so we wouldn&#8217;t have to make so many stops. I apparently refused to use it&#8211;yup, sounds like me&#8211;and held it until we got to the hotel.)
