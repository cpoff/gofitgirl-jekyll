    At 2 a.m. tomorrow we Spring Forward to 3 a.m.
  </p>

It&#8217;s that time of year again. Most places in North America will Spring Forward tomorrow at 2 a.m.  
To my Arizona family: No more confusion. Starting tomorrow we will be back in the same time zone. (For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Arizona doesn&#8217;t participate in Daylight Saving Time.)  
I hate Springing Forward or Falling Back. The time change, only one hour, completely messes me up.  
Normally my preparation for the time change means no difference in my routine. I make sure to keep up with my exercise and healthy eating. But I am nursing a cold. I don&#8217;t exercise when I am sick (and depending on the illness I eat whatever I feel like.)  
Usually I try to make sure to take the 6 p.m. Restorative yoga class Sunday nights. I think that helps with sleep. But depending on how I feel and if I can breathe through my stuffed-up nose &#8230;  
Sometimes the Restorative yoga teacher gives us tips if we are having trouble sleeping. A good stretch while lying on your back: Spread your arms and hands and your feet and yours legs and then let go.  
This is my advice on how to deal with the time change:

  * Don’t go to bed too late tonight.
  * Make sure you have breakfast tomorrow.
  * Try not to eat a lot of crap. Stick to fruits and veggies as snacks instead of sugary or salty foods.
  * Drinks lots of water tomorrow (but also today and always).
  * Exercise. (Usually I go to my regular yoga class tomorrow morning. Even going for a walk will be helpful.)
  * Keep up the exercise throughout the week, especially on Monday. It will be tough, but well worth it.
  * If you do nap tomorrow (I love my weekend naps), don’t nap too late.
  * If caffeine really affects you (doesn’t really for me) maybe cut back tomorrow and definitely don’t have it too late in the day.
  * Try to start winding your day down an hour before you go to bed. If you normally go to bed around 10, then at 9 make sure you are done for the day and ready for Monday’s workday. Do something relaxing for that hour: read a book, knit, lounge, take a bath, do the next item on the list.
  * Maybe try a cup of warm tea, cider or even hot cocoa to get you warm and cozy before bed.
  * Try taking melatonin. (I just starting taking this natural supplement and plan to write a post about it at some point.)
