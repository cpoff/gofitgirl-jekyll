I want to look like her.&#8221;  
Today I attended the noon spin class. I had plans tonight with friends and still wanted to work out. So I went to the noon spin class, which is usually taught by Jennifer. But Jennifer is on vacation so Heidi, the Zumba instructor, taught today.  
It was a different class, but still good and still hard. I usually leave a little early to get in the shower quickly and head back to work. Today as I was leaving Heidi said to the rest of the class &#8230; She looks great. I want to look like her.  
I was flattered and wanted to go back to the class and tell her I lost 30 pounds about three years ago.
