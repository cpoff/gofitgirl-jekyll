So after a very long sabbatical I started working out again &#8230; Well, I worked out Sunday.  
Maya (my Xbox Yourself!Fitness trainer) focused on lower body. We did a lot of lunges.  
I was a little tight yesterday. But today I am walking around like an old lady. At least I know it is working.  
Now I just have to keep up with [Yourself!Fitness](http://www.yourselffitness.com/) and really get into shape.
