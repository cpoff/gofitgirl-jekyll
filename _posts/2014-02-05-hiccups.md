I decided to do some research on why we get them. They are such a nuisance, aren&#8217;t they?  
Curt recommended me doing research on a yoga pose that helps stop hiccups. Why didn&#8217;t I think of that?  
**First, what is  a hiccup?**  
According to [Medical News Today](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9896.php), a [hiccup](http://dakinisbliss.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/hiccups.png) occurs when the [diaphragm](http://www.crossfitsouthbay.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/PUL_diaphragm_breathing.gif) suddenly contracts involuntarily, while at the same time the larynx (voice box) contracts too and the [glottis](http://www.cancer.gov/PublishedContent/Images/images/documents/dafda6d6-c840-4836-8009-439462a67b5a/1.jpg) closes, effective blocking the flow of air.  
**Why do we get hiccups?**  
The [Science Museum](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/snot/why_do_we_get_hiccups_and_how_do_you_stop_them.aspx) says that there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any known function of hiccups in the body. &#8230; Hiccups once served a purpose in the animals we evolved from. &#8230; One idea is that the hiccup evolved to help our four-legged ancestors to swallow food that got stuck in their throats. Where we have the luxury of gravity helping food down, quadrupeds (animals that walk on all fours) have to shift their food horizontally to get it from their mouths to their stomachs. This means it&#8217;s easier for lumps of food to get stuck in their throats. Some scientists think that lumps lodged like this might press down on a nerve in the throat which triggers the hiccup. The sharp breath in then creates a vaccuum behind the food, and helps the animal suck down the lump. This might explain why dogs (not known for eating their food slowly) seem so prone to hiccups &#8211; they &#8220;wolf&#8221; their food down in big lumps that they have to clear by hiccupping.  
[Kids Health](http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/hiccup.html) says that the diaphragm can become irritated. When this happens, it pulls down in a jerky way, which makes you suck air into your throat suddenly. When the air rushing in hits your voice box, you&#8217;re left with a big hiccup.  
**How do you get rid of hiccups?**  
We&#8217;ve heard the old wives&#8217; tales: drinking water a certain way, someone scaring you, holding your breath &#8230;  
Holding your breath makes sense since you are controlling breathing muscles, such as the diaphragm.  
Medical News Today lists many ways to get rid of hiccups. But the first one on the list is breathe in and hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then breathe out slowly. Repeat three or four times. Then do it again twenty minutes later.  
In my research I found a blog called [Total-Health-Yoga-and more](http://totalhealthyoga.blogspot.com/2007/12/cure-for-hiccups.html). She mentioned [Jalandhara Bandha](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2451) helped cure her hiccups.  
I found [another blog](http://dakinisbliss.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/how-to-cure-hiccups-try-uddiyana-bandha/) that mentioned [Uddiyana Bandha](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/1707), which is also a breathing technique and is similiar to Jalandhara Bandha.  
Be careful if you try these breathing techniques on your own for the first time. If you don&#8217;t want to try these, I suggest this: Sit comfortably, breathe in for a count, hold breath for same count, breathe out for same count, hold breath for same count. Try that a couple of times.
