The past three Saturdays my spin teacher has played [Watch Out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKFArxS949U). Since the first time Jennifer played that we always want her to play it. You really want to ride when that song comes on. It&#8217;s a great song to go all out on the bike.  
Today we actually agreed to start class two minutes early so Jennifer could add Watch Out to the playlist.  
Today in abs/core and body conditioning classes we used these [gliding disc things](http://www.glidingdiscs.com/). We have used them the past few weeks. Who knew that things a little thicker and sturdier than a paper plate could get you working hard? I am starting to hate those things.  
Two hours at the gym today was tough, hard and intense. Good workouts. Now I don&#8217;t feel quite as guilty for the cake and other goodies I had at a housewarming party tonight.
