Just a quick Christmas post to wish everyone a lovely day no matter how you spend it, celebrating or not.  
We are having a lazy, calm day starting with coffee and watching A Christmas Story. Red chili tamales to be consumed soon.  
We&#8217;ve already chatted with Curt&#8217;s parents this morning. We will follow up with a few more calls this morning with more family.  
I love Christmastime. And it is much more interesting this year with cardboard boxes surrounding the tree.  
Here&#8217;s to a safe and happy holiday season.
