Tonight in my yoga class Baxter made a good point. You shouldn&#8217;t be doing anything that creates pain. But challenge is OK. He said for him he usually knows the difference by checking on his breathing. If you are having a difficult time breathing or holding your breath it probably means you need to find your edge and take a step back.  
I think that is a great way to approach any type of exercise. But that is one of the many things I love about yoga. There is no competition; no attitude about no pain, no gain; no going beyond what you are capable of; finding your edge and taking a step back.
