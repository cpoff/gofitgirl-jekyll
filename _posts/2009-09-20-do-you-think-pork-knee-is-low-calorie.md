For mine and Curt&#8217;s last night in Prague we had dinner at U Vejvodu (we also had lunch there&#8211;I had an amazing cheese plate). We ordered aÂ roasted pork knee and pilsner.  
Man, it was so good. But it was greasy with tons of fat. I think all the walking I did counter acted the effects of the pork? Maybe?  
There was a lot of beer drinking this visit, too. The beer here is so good, especially at the St. Norbert monastery. Those guys know how to make some beer. Curt and I visited twice.  
We loved Prague. It is a city filled with history, beautiful architecture, delicious food, awesome beer and a wonderful and easy city to walk around in (easy exercise).
