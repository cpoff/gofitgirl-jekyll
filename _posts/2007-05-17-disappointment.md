So after &#8220;gaining&#8221; 2 bogus pounds &#8230;  
Curt and I went to an A&#8217;s/Royals game last night with some friends. I had saved up enough points for a cheeseburger and I was really looking forward to it.  
I couldn&#8217;t find a concession stand selling one! I walked all over the place and no luck. (And I have had a burger there before.) I didn&#8217;t want a hot dog or nachos or a pulled pork sandwich. I wanted a burger!  
So I settled for a hot pastrami sandwich. It was good&#8211;but I was still bummed.  
Plus the sandwich wasn&#8217;t something I had planned for. But I was fine&#8211;I was still within my points.
