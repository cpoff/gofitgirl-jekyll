consisted of two naps and many beers.  
So my plan Friday morning was to hit the gym. I actually slept in to almost 8 a.m. That is pretty late for me. It was dark and rainy. I got lazy and ended up napping.  
Then Curt and I headed to lunch and beers. Then home for another nap!  
Then I got ready to head out and have drinks with friends.  
So Friday wasn&#8217;t as productive in the workout category as I would have liked. But I did hit the gym for two hours on Saturday for my regular workout.
