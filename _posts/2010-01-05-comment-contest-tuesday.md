Instead of a guest post (mainly because I don&#8217;t have one) Comment Contest Tuesday is back for the new year.  
I am not a big new year&#8217;s resolution person because they generally don&#8217;t stick.  
But in the comments tell me something new you have started, want to start, are thinking about starting to becoming healthier or maybe something you already do that&#8217;s healthy and you want to share. It can be as simple as: drink less soda, no seconds, walk at least twice a week.  
You can comment as much as you like. The comment has to be health and fitness related. Up to three comments will be counted. In other words, you can comment five times, but your name will be put in the hat three times for the drawing of the winner. Make sense? Winner and prize will be announced on Monday.  
You have until Friday at noon (my time) to comment away. You have to comment in the comments on Go Fit Girl! I won&#8217;t accept e-mails, comments on Facebook, etc.  
OK, comment away. I can&#8217;t wait to hear your great ideas.
