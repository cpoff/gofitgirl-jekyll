    My clip shoes, asthma inhaler, water bottle and towel are all necessities for me for a good spin class.

Having the right equipment makes all the difference.  
When I got to the gym this morning I realized I forgot my clip shoes. Ah, bummer. I probably had time to go home and get them. But I decided to just deal with regular shoes.  
I had to use my regular tennies on the spin bike a couple of months ago when I had a broken clip and couldn&#8217;t get my shoe into the pedal.  
It is such a different feeling in regular tennis shoes than clip shoes. I can feel the pedal under my feet, my control is different, I get foot cramps more often, my feet sometimes fall asleep, I don&#8217;t feel as sturdy.  
I also feel that way the my newer yoga mat. For years I used a [Gaiam yoga mat](http://www.gaiam.com/product/eco+yoga+mat+citrus.do) I got at Target. It got the job done.  
But as I started practicing yoga more and going to a studio regularly I knew I needed a better mat. The Gaiam mat is quite slippery. And my hands never stuck very well the to &#8220;sticky&#8221; mat.  
So I invested in a nice [Jade yoga mat](http://www.jadeyoga.com/store/yoga-mats-execise-mats-pilates-mats/). Yes, it is expensive. But it is sturdy and high quality. My hands still slip a little, but not anywhere as much. All in all it is just a better yoga mat to practice on.  
Having the right equipment makes all the difference to have a better yoga practice or workout experience.
