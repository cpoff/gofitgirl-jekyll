Today&#8217;s class was taken over by a different teacher. Sean had a major following&#8211;filling the class to capacity almost every Sunday. We maxed out at 40 with our mats about an inch apart from each other.  
Today we didn&#8217;t even have 20, which was good and bad. Hopefully Ashley will start getting more students. Her class was good and a hard workout and sweaty and all that. Â This class and the norm on Sundays gets your heart pumping.
