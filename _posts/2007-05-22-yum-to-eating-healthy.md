Went to P.F. Chang&#8217;s today. Everyone wanted to do family style. I told them that was fine, but I wouldn&#8217;t be participating and I wouldn&#8217;t be sharing. (Not that anyone wanted any of my steamed veggies, but still.)  
  
Of course, I was given a hard time that I am already skinny enough and we don&#8217;t want your steamed veggies and you and your points. Two friends did say nice things&#8211;Mia mentioned that I have done really well and am so close to my goal. Graciela mentioned to everyone how I had already figured my food out (which I had).  
  
I know the comments are a reflection on the one making them and not me. And I realize a lot of it is jealously. But it isn&#8217;t like I haven&#8217;t worked hard for my weight loss.  
And this isn&#8217;t just about weight loss. It is also about making healthier choices and eating healthy. If they only knew how much fat and calories they were consuming&#8211;and I am not judging.  
Because believe me I wanted the calamari, fried crab wontons and other delicious stuff. But I didn&#8217;t stray&#8211;and it was tough! I didn&#8217;t snack on any appetizers and I just waited for my veggies and brown rice.  
I was satisfied&#8211;ate all of my veggies and I felt good afterward. And I was proud of myself for having the will power to stay away from the yummy, fatty, salty food!
