The other night I wasn&#8217;t sure what to have for dinner. I was looking in the pantry and I saw that I had some [Fiber One Original cereal](http://www.fiberone.com/product/Cereals.aspx). I grabbed that and added some blueberries that I had bought to add to my homemade smoothies.  
I had that for breakfast yesterday, today and for a snack last night. (I have guitar class on Tuesdays&#8211;so I try to eat something at work about 5 p.m. and then eat a light snack around 9 p.m. at home.)  
And now I am out of both the cereal and blueberries. Boo! But I will be buying some more at the grocery this weekend.  
Yummy and healthy and filling&#8211;that is really the most important part.
