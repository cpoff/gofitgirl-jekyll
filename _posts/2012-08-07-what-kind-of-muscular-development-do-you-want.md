    Working those biceps. I want nicely shaped and toned arms (and legs).

It&#8217;s a good thing I pre-wrote some posts over the weekend in anticipation of a busy week.  
Between work, working on the shuttle bus on the way home, coming home and working, getting exercise in, visiting friend&#8217;s cat while she is away, being dressed suitably for work each day and still eating healthy I really had to do some planning over the weekend.  
And it helps that I stole this directly from a Facebook post from [In-Shape City](http://www.inshapeclubs.com) (my gym):

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Â The amount of weight you lift should be dependent on your desired muscular development goal. What does this mean?
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  If you want to build muscle size and strength&#8211;heavy weights, which you can properly lift approximately 6-10 times is the most effective, resting at least one minute between each exercise set.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  If you want to tone your muscles&#8211;lighter weights, which you can properly lift approximately 12-20 times is the most effective, resting less than 1 minute between each exercise set.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Remember! Mix things up to prevent plateaus: light weights, heavy weights, super-sets, stability balls, boss ball, kettle-bells, etc.
</p>

I feel like attending classes really helps me mix things up. Sometimes I work out on my own and I try to vary it up. But classes give me new ideas and challenge me. And I can chose whether I want to go with a heavier weight or lighter&#8211;depending on how I am feeling that day or how strong my body feels as well.
