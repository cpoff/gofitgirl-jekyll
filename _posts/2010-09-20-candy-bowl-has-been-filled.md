[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3804" title="candy bowl" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/candy-bowl2-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/candy-bowl2.jpg)I have had a candy bowl at my desk for about five years. It started one Halloween when we lived in Berkeley and I figured we would have a ton of kids so I got lots of candy. We didn&#8217;t.  
Co-workers love it and that is really why I have it.  
Lately the candy bowl has been a huge distraction in regards to my limited calorie intake and healthy eating. I just couldn&#8217;t fill it &#8230; otherwise I would just eat all the candy.  
Lately I have felt once I start I just can&#8217;t stop. So my solution was to stop stocking the bowl.  
Yesterday when I was at the grocery I told myself I was ready to restock the bowl. So I got some candy and today I dumped it into the bowl. I never felt any craving for chocolate&#8211;and peanut butter cups are my absolute fave. I just told myself what my goal is right now&#8211;to get back to my goal weight. I don&#8217;t want to fall back into my bad habits of stuffing my face with crap, especially when I am stressed, overwhelmed or upset.  
Let&#8217;s see how Day 2 goes with the overflowing chocolately goodness sitting at my desk.
