So last night I had a glass and a half of wine and it knocked me out before 9:30 p.m.!!!!!!  
The night before I had about the same amount and had to fight to stay awake for that movie Premonition&#8211;which wasn&#8217;t as good as I had hoped.  
I have been getting up at 6 a.m. during the week&#8211;to either hit yoga at 7:15 or to be at work around 7ish to make up for the time I take off early on Mondays.

Speaking of yoga &#8230; we were doing these lunge things today and I felt pretty confident about my posture when my wonderful teacher Sarah said, Nice Ann! She told all of us we had lovely lunges.  
I have to say I am definitely getting better and finding some postures much easier. About a month or so ago I was actually able to clear my mind a couple of times during meditation. I was so excited that I started thinking about how I wasn&#8217;t thinking. Dang it!  
  
But lately I have noticed that my slight [scoliosis](http://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/guide/arthritis-scoliosis) and [kyphosis](http://www.kyphon.com/us/patient.aspx?contentid=37&siteid=1) are really showing more in some of my postures. (Maybe I just didn&#8217;t notice before.) Especially in [plank pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/470). I look like a total hunchback. The more I exercise the better my posture will become. I slouch&#8211;it hurts for me to sit up straight because of the curvature of my spine. So sitting for long periods of time really bothers me&#8211;like on a plane or sometimes at the movies.  
  
Anyway, Happy Friday!
