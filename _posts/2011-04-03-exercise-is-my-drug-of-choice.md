I saw this on a license plate frame yesterday. It gave me a chuckle. Even though I regularly exercise, exercise is definitely not my drug of choice. Mine is probably alcohol and then high fat, high calorie food. So in the end I need exercise.  
One of my regular readers and good friends asked if I could recommend a yoga class that is gentle with some good stretching.  
I wasn&#8217;t quite sure, so I did a little research &#8230;  
I do take a Hatha Yoga class on Wednesday nights and I would say it is much more gentle than the other yoga classes I take. The Yoga Journal Web site gave me an actual [gentle yoga routine](http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/2316). [Restorative Yoga](http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/991) is also a gentle practice and so lovely and juicy.  
[Another link with gentle yoga poses](http://www.wholeliving.com/article/gentle-yoga-poses). This [search link](http://www.yogajournal.com/search?q=gentle+form+of+yoga) on the Yoga Journal Web site also has a bunch of options for gentle forms of yoga.  
In my Vinyasa class today while I was in [Downward Dog](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/491) my instructor came over and told my that my pose was great. If you know Downward Facing Dog you know that it is a pretty simple and easy pose. But in my almost four years of fairly regular yoga practice I am amazed out how much better I have gotten and how much deeper I can get into the pose. It is an amazing feeling and accomplishment when we get close to mastering a pose&#8211;if that is really ever possible.
