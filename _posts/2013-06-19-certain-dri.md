    My co-worker/friend who suggested Certain Dri to me also said she keeps it by the bed as it is to be applied at bedtime.
  </p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As embarrassing as it is to admit, I am an excessive underarm sweater/perspier.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I have tried a variety of deodorants and anti-perspirants and nothing has worked that well. And I have ruined a lot of shirts.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Recently a friend/co-worker told me about Certain Dri, an anti-perspirant, which claims to be clinical strength.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I decided to at least give it a try. And so far it seems to be working for me.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I have been using it for about a month and the underarm sweat has been drastically reduced.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I got the roll on at Target. It contains 12% aluminum chloride, which, according to the package insert, is prescribed to those with hyperhidrosis or excessive perspiration. Aluminum chloride works to shrink and close off underarm pores.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The package inset says when using Certain Dri nature simply and safely redistributes the perspiration to the rest of the body&#8217;s skin surface.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  According to an article on <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/underarm-care/problems/question627.htm">Discovery Fit & Health</a>, aluminum chloride in high concentrations may ultimately shrink the sweat gland, decreasing the amount of sweat it can produce.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The FDA requires that over-the-counter anti-perspirants contain no more than 15% to 25% of the active ingredient, depending on what it is. The FDA also requires that all anti-perspirants must decrease the average person&#8217;s sweat by at least 20%.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I checked my stick of Secret to see what the active ingredient is. It contains 19% of aluminum zirconium tricholorhydex glycine.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The pH balanced anti-perspirant/deodorant works better than the Degree I used to use. The Degree I used contains about 18% aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex glycine. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_zirconium_tetrachlorohydrex_gly">Wikipedia</a>, aluminum zirconium tretrachlorohydrex glycine functions by diffusing into the sweat gland and forming a collodial &#8220;plug,&#8221; which limits the flow of sweat to the skin surface.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  From the research I have done it seems that aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex glycine is the same as aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex glycine.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The aluminum chloride so far seems to be the best active ingredient for me.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Initially the Certain Dri is used every day and eventually it is to be used just a few times a week.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In my research I found that some believe aluminum chloride can cause certain health issues I am not going to go into those issues as I haven&#8217;t found anything scientific or concrete to prove any of them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  If you want to know more about the history of the anti-perspirant, <a href="http://prezi.com/jsygo3rsaxfh/chemistry-how-it-works/">this link</a> gives a quick, easy and interesting read.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The roll on doesn&#8217;t travel well. The liquid spilled all over the place. Luckily I had put it in a plastic bag. I have only seen the roll on to buy in the stories. So I recently purchased the stick for p.m. and a.m. online. I haven&#8217;t received them yet.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Certain Dri works best when applied at night. I took the suggestion of my friend/co-worker and keep the roll on by the bed. Because nothing is worse than being all cozy in bed and half asleep when you realize you have to get up.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But I have to say I have noticed a drastic reduction in sweat since I started using Certain Dri about a month ago. I will continue to use this and looking forward to trying the solid version. Certain Dri gets 4 1/2 dumbbells.

        Certain Dri does what it says and works well. I give it 4 1/2 dumbbells.
