Twice a year I write about time change. (Read last year’s Spring Forward [post here](http://gofitgirl.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=13341&action=edit).)  
It’s that time again to Spring Forward (Sunday at 2 a.m.). I am not a fan of time change.  
I seriously don’t get the point of it. I grew up in Arizona where time change doesn’t occur.  
So to my Arizona family members who can never quite get the time difference: Starting Sunday we will be on the same time.  
This is the advice I like to give on how to deal with time change:

  * Don’t go to bed too late Saturday and Sunday night.
  * Make sure you have breakfast Sunday morning (and every morning).
  * Try not to eat a lot of crap. Stick to fruits and veggies as snacks instead of sugary or salty foods.
  * Drinks lots of water Saturday and Sunday (and every day).
  * Exercise. (At least a walk sometime Sunday and maybe even Saturday.) I&#8217;ll be doing my own yoga home practice as I am teaching an indoor cycle class Sunday morning and a yoga class Sunday afternoon.
  * Keep up the exercise throughout the week, especially on Monday. It will be tough, but well worth it.
  * If you do nap Sunday (I love my weekend naps), don’t nap too late.
  * If caffeine really affects you, maybe cut back Sunday and definitely don’t have it too late in the day.
  * Try to start winding your day down an hour before you go to bed on Sunday. If you normally go to bed around 10, then at 9 make sure you are done for the day and ready for Monday’s workday. Do something relaxing for that hour: read a book, knit, lounge, take a bath, do the next item on the list.
  * Maybe try a cup of warm tea, cider or even hot cocoa to get you warm and cozy before bed.
  * Perhaps take Melatonin (a natural supplement). I wouldn’t take this for the first time Sunday night. And you should discuss this with your doctor first. You want to make sure it doesn’t make you groggy the next morning. So maybe try it a night or two before the time change if this will be a first time for you.
  * Do a gentle yoga practice. Anytime is nice. But later in the afternoon or soon before bed can help with your sleep. This week I am teaching a sequence for time change, transition, insomnia, stress, anxiety and even sadness. Try a couple of simple poses: Lie on your back and hug your knees to your chest; [Jathara Parivartanasana](http://www.theyogasanctuary.biz/ys/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/twist-page-pix.jpg) (Reclined Twist); [Uttanasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/standing-forward-bend/) (Standing Forward Fold); [Adho Mukha Svanasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/downward-facing-dog/) (Downward Facing Dog); [Supported Setu Bandha](https://breastcanceryogablog.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/supported-bridge-4.jpg?w=350&h=200&crop=1) (Supported Bridge Pose); [Viparita Karani](http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/legs-up-the-wall-pose/) (Legs Up the Wall). (I [wrote a post sharing a yoga sequence for sadness](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/09/curbing-sadness-yoga-practice/), which I think benefits many things, including calming the body and mind for rest. Feel free to try it out.)

Any of my readers have any other suggestions or things they do?
