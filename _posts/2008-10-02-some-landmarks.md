In my adv. body conditioning class we usually use two sets of dumbbells. When I first started the class a couple of months ago I started with the smallest hand weights, 2 pounders. Recently I graduated to the 3 pounders.  
Yesterday I actually used two sets of hand weights. When Gerry (pronounced Gary) told us to use our heavier weights I went up to 5 pounds. It was tough, but good. I could feel my muscles bulging!  
Then today in kickboxing &#8230; we only had four people in the class. Two were new. Usually when we start the class Keren tells anyone who gets lost to follow the girls in front&#8211;they usually know what side to be punching on and they look good doing it. I was one of those girls today. I mean, Betsy (who always looks awesome, I still look like a spaz) is usually one of those girls.  
I realize I was one of the two regular students in the class. But still, it was awesome. And I am getting so much better. Punching harder, keeping up, staying on the correct side. And I am looking a little less spazzy.
