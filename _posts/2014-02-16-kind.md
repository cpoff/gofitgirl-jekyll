    I told a friend the other day that I have too many plates in the air. Was that my exhaustion talking? I do have too much on my plate and too many balls in the air right now.

I recently wrote a post about being a [chaotic hot mess](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/02/mess/).  
Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m OK. I&#8217;m just exhausted.  
I know I haven&#8217;t posted lately. Sorry about that. I just couldn&#8217;t muster the energy for a blog post this past week.  
Nothing super terrible is happening in my life. It&#8217;s just a lot of stuff. And I feel overwhelmed by it all.  
Work is stressful. Waking up at 5 a.m. on the days I go into the office are wearing on me as is my commute. (It&#8217;s been almost three years.) Work is crazy busy, different after transitions and stressful. I love my yoga teacher training, but that adds an element of stress. Things are gearing up with my Observing and Assisting portion of the teacher training.  
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">And that&#8217;s just work and school. We all have things going on in our personal lives as well. Losing a longtime family friend and professor. Worrying about your grandpa. </span>  
When all of that is going on the little things can really weigh on me as well. I am sure (I really hope) I am not the only one who can have something minor happen and it brings you to tears.  
Times like this I remind myself that it is OK. That I will be OK. And that I need to take a step back and do what I need to do to take care of me.  
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Once February hit I was happy to realize I had survived January as I knew it would be a tough month. I think the past fews weeks have just caught up with me.</span>  
On Tuesday I was at the brink of my exhaustion and was brought to tears. I decided I had to take Friday off and take care of me. I made an appointment for a massage at the [Claremont](http://www.claremontresort.com/spa-treat-massages.shtml), where I also utilized the steam room, whirl pool, shower with 11 shower heads (yes, I know California is in a drought), a lounging area and cucumber water. I was pretty much a noodle after spending about three hours at the day spa.  
That evening I also made it to a Restorative Yoga class. Because it was Valentine&#8217;s Day the teacher talked about self-compassion, which so many of us lack. As we breathed in she reminded us of acceptance and as we breathed out she reminded us to surrender.  
I knew I needed to take care of me. And that&#8217;s what I did. Luckily I had no plans this weekend. The spare room/office needed some organizing. I built some shelves I got from Target and the room looks very adult. It is quite exciting.  
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Sometimes when my surroundings are in chaos it is difficult for me to relax or concentrate. When I was in college I had the cleanest apartment the night before an exam. </span>  
I took this weekend to sleep in and relax and do whatever felt right.  
And I know that some of my dear friends have a lot more shit going on in their lives. But we shouldn&#8217;t compare ourselves to others. Because whatever shit is yours is yours. And if it is hanging on for you then it is.  
This is a good reminder that not everything is as it seems. So be kind to each other. We don&#8217;t know why someone is in a bad mood. And it likely has nothing to do with us.
