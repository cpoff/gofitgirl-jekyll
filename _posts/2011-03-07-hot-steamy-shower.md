A hot, steamy shower was not what I had after spin class today. Not that I normally do, it is usually lukewarm and I try not to touch anything while I am in the shower stall and I have to wear flip flops. Not the greatest shower experience, but it is still a shower.  
Spin was a good and hard and sweaty workout, as usual. Once class was over I headed to the locker room for a quick shower before heading back to work. I get there and there are signs posted stating that the toilets and the showers are out of order!  
There are two noon classes at the gym. And both are intense with sweaty people as a result. I did the sink shower the best I could. No one ever mentioned that I was stinky today after I returned to work. So I think I pulled it off.
