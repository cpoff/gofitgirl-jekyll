I went to yoga this morning. It was a pretty good practice and I felt really good afterward. I have to say it was really super tough to get up this morning. But I did it!  
And I also attended a Weight Watchers at Work meeting today.  
So I feel accomplished in the world of taking care of my health.  
Funny thing is I am going out for drinks after work to help send off a fellow co-worker. I am just staying for one drink. (Too much to do at home.)
