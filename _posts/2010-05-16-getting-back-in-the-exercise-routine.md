My plan (after being gone from the gym for 5 weeks: getting sick and then being on vacation) this week was to immediately get back into my regular workout routine. Not sure why I thought that would happen. I guess I was hoping it would since I knew it would help with the jet lag.  
I went to spin on Monday. I didn&#8217;t work that day. Paid bills, ran errands, did laundry, etc. Didn&#8217;t get back to the gym until Saturday (long h0urs at work got in the way of my gym time) for my regular two hours of spin; abs; body conditioning. I was planning to go to the gym this morning. I started to feel sore last night from class and then this morning &#8230; OUCH!  
Curt and I put our garden in today. That was a major workout in itself. Curt shovels the dirt in the garden and I hoe it. Hoeing is hard work.  
The plan is to get back into the workout routine this week. Then I will slowly tackle the calorie intake. That got way out of control while on vacation. So much good food and beer and wine. Not sure if my walking a lot helped at all. I have been too scared and busy to check the scale.
