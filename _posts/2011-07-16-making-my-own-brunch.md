    My after the gym meal: Peanut Butter Banana Stuffed French Toast.
  </p>
</div>

  
Sometime back Curt and I were watching the Food Network and a restaurant that was visited hadÂ [Peanut Butter and Banana Stuffed French Toast](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bobby-flay/peanut-butter-and-banana-stuffed-french-toast-recipe/index.html) on the menu. It looked and sounded so good. I made my own version.  
For some reason when I came home from the gym today I was craving it. My version is much healthier. Probably doesn&#8217;t taste as good. But I think it is pretty tasty.  
I use [Sara Lee Delightfuls](http://www.saraleebread.com/our-bread/delightful) bread; crunchy peanut butter (I am normally a creamy girl, but for this recipe crunchy works better); banana; egg whites; fat free milk; and a little cinnamon sprinkled in the egg and milk.  
I spray the pan with Pam and cook away. They are easy to make and cook up quickly. Once ready to eat I added a little syrup, though that really isn&#8217;t necessary. I use [Smucker&#8217;s Sugar Free syrup](http://www.smuckers.com/products/ProductDetail.aspx?groupId=5&categoryId=52&flavorId=130&gclid=CMnXrabyhqoCFUUZQgodzlmu0Q). A serving is 1/4 of a cup. That&#8217;s a lot of syrup. I only drizzled a little on mine.
