    Here I am catching some air on the trampoline. I learned a few fun tricks. After that I tried the trapeze. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ic2MkPPm_w">Link to trapeze video here</a>.

Another great thing about Club Med is there are activities for just about everyone.  
(And if your thing is to just lounge at the beach and drink, there&#8217;s plenty of that for you. That&#8217;s my favorite pastime.)  
Like most trips I brought exercise clothes with me. And about half the time they don&#8217;t leave the suitcase. This trip seems to be turning out that way.  
Besides, sailing, windsurfing, snorkeling, scuba and other water activities &#8220;regular&#8221; exercise classes are also offered along with a gym.  
There&#8217;s power walking, stretching (which I think is kinda like yoga, but since I haven&#8217;t gone I am not certain), abs and butts, Zumba, boot camp, water aerobics, etc.  
There is also the circus where I tried doing tricks on the trampoline. It&#8217;s fun, but man, is that a work out. I probably did 15 minutes on the trampoline and then took a break before trying the trapeze.  
The beginners got a quick lesson on how to stand, hold the bar and the few tricks we were going to do.  
The scariest part for me was when I had to grab the bar with my second hand. That meant I was trusting someone to hold on to me until I was ready to swing through the air.  
[This video shows my second attempt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ic2MkPPm_w) on the trapeze. I felt like my first attempt was better. But this isn&#8217;t too shabby either.  
Yesterday a major rainstorm hit. So many of us were huddled under the covered areas. Curt was playing pool and I was having a drink and enjoying the rain. The Zumba teacher, Patricia, came up to me and asked if I wanted to do Zumba. I am personally not a fan of Zumba.  
(Anything where I have to be in step and coordinated in a routine I pretty much suck at, which is why I don&#8217;t do aerobics or step and why yoga, spin and body conditioning classes are best for me.)  
But I decided to be a good sport and go with it. It was fun. But I was glad the class was only a half an hour.  
Every night at Club Med there is a show, which lasts 30-45 minutes and then dancing afterward. Last night there were two shows and then dancing. Curt and I stayed for the dancing for a bit.  
Curt and I are going on an all day snorkeling trip tomorrow. So I figure that&#8217;s plenty of exercise.
