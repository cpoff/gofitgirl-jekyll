As long as I can remember food was always a very important thing to my relatives when I was growing up. On every visit one of the first questions asked was &#8220;Did you eat yet?&#8221; and before I could answer a bowl of food was literally pushed in front of my face. It really shouldn’t be a question because I couldn&#8217;t turn it down or else I would get a look of disappointment and I ended up feeling guilty so I just accepted it and I ate whatever I was served. It didn’t matter if I was hungry or not, but as long as I ate everyone was happy.  
I eventually learned that food equals care. So when grandma gave you food, it means she cared and for you not to accept meant the same as rejecting her care.  
When I grew up I picked up this food pushing practice. If people were visiting or I was visiting someone I always had goodies with me. I never realized how hard this could be on someone who was watching their weight until an ex-boyfriend gained 20 pounds from being with me! His weakness was his grandmother’s banana pie recipe, which I made weekly for him. I finally had to stop because he told me about his weight gain and he was not happy.  
Initially my feelings were hurt because I felt like he didn’t appreciate how much I cared, but realized it was not personal and that he just didn’t want to be overweight. It was hard for me not to make the dessert, but I forced myself to stop.  
Pretty much the same thing happened with my current boyfriend. I loved to give him large portions of food at each meal because it meant I cared about him. Next thing I knew he started to grow a little tummy and he started telling me he had to cut back. I tried hard not to show him my feeling here hurt, but they were! I felt rejected and he had to assure me he cared about me and loved the meals I prepared. But he just didn’t like the extra weight he had put on. After this I realized how I turned into my relatives and how addicting food pushing was for me.  
Food still means care to me so it’s a hard addiction to get over. Eventually over time I had to learn to stop plopping food in front of people. Just ask once or twice and that is it. No more feeling hurt if someone says, &#8220;no thank you, I’m full.&#8221;
