Last night I took a full hour and a half of Restorative Yoga. It was amazing. And it was a great way to ease back into exercise after not working out for a week because of my cold.  
According to the [Namaste Yoga](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ASP/home.asp?studioid=607) web site, Restorative Yoga is:Â Gentle yoga and passive restorative postures to open the body, quiet the mind and move into a deep sense of relaxation. A meditative time to cultivate awareness of body breath and mind, this class is recommended for those experiencing stress, recovering from injury or illness, and anyone seeking a gentle class to unwind, relax and renew. This class is appropriate for beginners.  
In class last night, we did three poses in an hour and a half and they were all on our back. We used lots of props: blocks, blankets, sandbags, bolsters. It was truly amazing. [This is similar to a pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/663) we did last night, but with many more props.  
The instructor talked about the class being a reset button. It was a great way to end the weekend and prepare myself for the new week.
