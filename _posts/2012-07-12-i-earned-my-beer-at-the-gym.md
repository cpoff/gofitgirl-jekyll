    Weights were part of the routine tonight.

Tonight my friend Monica and I decided to try a class fellow gym friends have been raving about. One of our friends has lost 6 pounds by taking the class, is so much more tone and her booty looks amazing!  
This is how the [In-Shape City site describes Total Athletic Conditioning](http://www.inshapeclubs.com/clubs/schedule/4722/):Â A full body workout with an emphasis on increasing Cardio, Endurance, Strength, Agility and Balance. (50) Minutes of continuous movement with a Sports Conditioning Approach. It&#8217;s really 60 minutes and then we stretch.  
Wow, talk about an amazing cardio and strength workout. We were drenched in sweat, tired and felt good.  
There was a lot of jumping, lunges, weights, squats, kicks &#8230;  
Tomorrow late morning I have a doctor&#8217;s appointment to get some vaccines before we go to Mexico City next month. One of the shots is a tetanus and pertussis shot. So my arm will be sore afterward and I won&#8217;t be able to go to my regular Friday night yoga class. I thought about taking the 6:30 a.m. class. Then I looked at the schedule and see that it is the same instructor as tonight and Total Athletic Conditioning. I asked Will about it. He said the class is a little different&#8211;more running around &#8230;  
If I wake up on time and I feel OK I am gonna go for it. Check back tomorrow to see if I made it or took a day off from exercise.  
Between the hard core workout and my beer with dinner I think I will sleep well tonight.
