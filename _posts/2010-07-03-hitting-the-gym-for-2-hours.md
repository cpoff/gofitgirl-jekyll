I hit the gym this morning for my regular Saturday two-hour work out. The past few Saturdays I made spin and abs/core but missed body conditioning.  
Body conditioning was a butt kicker this morning. Man, Jessica worked us out hard. It was a good work out and I am sure I will feel it later.  
The music was awesome, which helped with the evil squats we had to do.
