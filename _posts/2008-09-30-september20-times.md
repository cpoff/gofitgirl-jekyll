Well, I never did get to take that walk I wanted to take yesterday afternoon. Besides the fact that I was a total zombie I was so busy at work.  
But even with an altered schedule (being out of town even for a short weekend can throw me off) I still worked out 20 times in the month of September. That averages out to 5 times a week.  
I just came back from my yoga class. It was a wonderful class. And I almost fell asleep during [savasana&#8211;also known as corpse pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482).  
Oh, and I was very excited to see an Ann Taylor Loft banner ad the other day. My favorite clothing store. I treat myself at times to some shopping there since I lost weight.
