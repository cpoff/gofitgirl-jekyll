About 4 o&#8217;clock today I felt snacky. I wasn&#8217;t hungry &#8230; But I still walked into the kitchen and looked at the snacks available. Not a lot of options. I thought about the peanuts, popcorn, unfortunately we are out of cheese&#8211;cheese stick would have been good. I looked through my options and realized I really didn&#8217;t need anything and I would be having an apple and peanut butter shortly before heading to spin.  
I felt good about my decision to not take in any unnecessary calories.  
Tonight I participated in my fourth spin class for the week. Each class has been so different, different teacher each time. Yet all great workouts. I think three spin classes in one week was my previous &#8220;record.&#8221;  
So today I am proud of myself in my hard work and will power. It ain&#8217;t easy.
