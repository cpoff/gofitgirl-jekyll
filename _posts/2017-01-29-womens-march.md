  &#8220;We work peacefully while recognizing there is no true peace without justice and equity for all.&#8221;

I along, with millions of others, around the globe marched and protested last Saturday, Jan. 21.  
It felt amazing to be surrounded by love, kindness, mutual respect &#8230; to feel welcomed, loved and safe.  
Marches around the globe were peaceful. Just as a peaceful protest should be.  
I loved looking at all of my friends&#8217; pictures posted on social media and pictures from around the United States and world. Check out pictures posted on the [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/21/world/womens-march-pictures.html?_r=0) website. It&#8217;s so powerful, beautiful and amazing. I took a few photos at the march in Portland, Ore. You can [view them here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154055820356574.1073741831.715276573&type=1&l=cebddb1c4c).  
Why did I march?  
I marched because I believe our president has made clear that he doesn&#8217;t care about all Americans. He has openly lied. He has mocked, offended, said awful, terrible things about women, people of color, people with disabilities, immigrants, non-Christian religions, a Gold Star family, the media, etc. A true president represents ALL Americans.  
I believe he is just in this for himself. A president works for the people. He should be serving all Americans. I don&#8217;t believe he is doing that in things he has said and actions he has already taken while in office just a little more than a week.  
While all the marches were amazing we need to make sure our voices are heard again and again. We need to continue to let the president and the administration know that we won&#8217;t stand for the ugliness and the hate. As one of my friends posted on Facebook, My country is breaking my heart.  
If you aren&#8217;t sure what to do there are so many small things we can do. If you can afford it, donate money to an charity/organization that you feel strongly about. If you can&#8217;t afford to donate money, maybe your time or other resources (such as a skill you can share).  
You can also go on to the [Women&#8217;s March website](https://www.womensmarch.com) and participate in the [10 actions for the first 100 days campaign](http://www.womensmarch.com/100?source=direct_link&).  
I participated in the first action and sent postcards to my senators. (The 10 actions link will find your senators and give you their addresses.)  
Remember peace, love, kindness, compassion, understanding, patience and honor.  
In my classes: All students are welcome. All students are loved. And all students are safe.  
I end each yoga class with: Keep peace in the mind &#8230; Strength in the body &#8230; And love in the heart. Namaste.
