Today is Day 7 of me getting back to healthy living. I worked out six times this week and counted points (tracked food) every day and stayed on track.  
Once I got going again with tracking my food it was liking riding a bike. The hardest part is the willpower. But once you get back on track with that it is no biggie at all.  
I am proud of myself for getting one week under my belt. And I was still able to have yummy food, wine, cheese and other delicious things that I love.  
Let&#8217;s see how Week 2 goes.
