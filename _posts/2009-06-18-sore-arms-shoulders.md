My regular morning yoga teacher has been out of town. So she has had two subs: Ken and Jennifer. I like both of them. They are so different.  
Yesterday Ken had us continuously do [vinyasa flows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-Zp8Go7yYc).  
There are many variations of vinyasa flows. But the video above gives you an idea. I think what really made me sore was going back and forth between [downward dog](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/491) and [plank](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/470) to a [push up (or really a push down)](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/469).  
My arms and shoulders are pretty sore. I love that good kind of sore.
