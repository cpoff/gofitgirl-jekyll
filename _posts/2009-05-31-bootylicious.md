I just read an article giving tips on making your butt tighter and firmer. (I hate the word tush and refuse to use it, even though the article does.)  
I dislike squats and lunges, but that is what works for the firmness.  
All of the exercises seem pretty good, except for the jumping lunges. Those seem a little dangerous, especially for a klutz like me.  
But I will let you be the judge: [Look Divine From Behind](http://health.yahoo.com/experts/healthieryou/10918/look-divine-from-behind/).  
I write this as I am having my night snack of fresh cut strawberries with a little Splenda sprinkled on them. Yummy!
