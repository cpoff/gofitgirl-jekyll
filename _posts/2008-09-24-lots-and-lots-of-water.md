So yesterday for lunch I had sushi. Which is a very good choice when trying to eat healthy. It is filling and so good for you.  
Soy sauce&#8211;even low sodium&#8211;has me retain water like crazy. One night I had sushi and then the next day weighed in with a GAIN. I was so upset. (This was when I was still losing weight.) So I made it a point to never weigh in after sushi the day before.  
Well, I really did want to weigh in today. So yesterday I had a lot of water. I mean like 14 8 oz. servings. You really only need six to eight 8 oz. servings a day. But if you drink alcohol, a lot of caffeine, soy sauce, etc. you need to counteract the dehydration with more water.  
I didn&#8217;t want the soy sauce to alter the number on the scale today.  
And I did OK. I am still within 2 pounds of my goal weight. Once you hit your goal weight with Weight Watchers to stay Lifetime and attend meetings for free you can&#8217;t be more than 2 pounds over your goal weight.
