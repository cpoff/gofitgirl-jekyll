A friend/co-worker told me the other day that she is about to take her first spin class.  
I am excited for her to try the class.  
I have been doing spin for about 3 1/2 years and it is still hard and kicks my ass. It is an amazing workout and a great way to burn calories.  
I told her to not expect to be able to keep up with the whole class. And it will be hard!  
We hope to visit the work gym so I can show her how to set up on an actual bike.  
In the meantime here is what I advised below (which is what I have learned in beginner spin classes and spin teachers in the past):  
For the seat height (red arrow): Stand next to it. The top of the seat should be about the level of your hip. When you sit on the bike Â and your leg is fully extended it should have a slight bend.  
For the proximity of the seat to the handle bars (blue arrow): You should have a slight bend in your arms.  
For the height of the handle bars (purple arrow): This is totally your preference, whether you want to feel like you are on a bike cruiser or a road racing bike. As a beginner I would recommend now lower than 7. I usually ride at a 7 or 8.  
I also reminded her to have a towel and water.
