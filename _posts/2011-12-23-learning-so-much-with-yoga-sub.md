    As Ai pointed out in class today, Child's pose is likely the pose that most love. Child's likely has no love/hate relationship, just love. I have to agree.

The 10 a.m. yoga class had a sub. Like most regulars I get used to the same yoga classes with the same instructors. But I am almost always OK with a sub as you learn something new or have a new experience. (Sometimes that is not the case. But at Namaste there has never been a sub I haven&#8217;t liked.)  
Ai (pronounced I) taught class today. She was awesome. The practice was great. And she gave so many amazing tips while teaching us. I am going to try to remember them to share with you:

  * Please listen to your body, not your ego.
  * Move forward with your heart and not your forehead. You don&#8217;t want to focus with your mind but your emotion.
  * We just had winter solstice so our days are longer and our days are shorter, which can affect our minds and bodies.
  * Our minds are scattered at this time of the year with holidays, parties, stress, etc. so we need to focus on keeping strength in our midline.
  * There are some poses we have a love/hate relationship with. We feel in the dark with them. But once we are able to &#8220;conquer&#8221; them we see the light. (Mine is [Happy Baby](http://www.yogajournal.com/media/originals/YIN_213_AnandaBalasana_248.jpg).)
  * We are scared of some poses, which are reflected in the light/dark. One we practiced today was [Crow pose](http://www.trueyogainc.com/uploaded_images/Crow-Pose-701915.JPG). A great tip Ai gave us was to use a block for your forehead, which made it less scary. Once you feel confident you can lift your forehead off the block.
  * We really focused on pulling our feet toward the midline to help us keep our focus in yoga and in the real world. We did this in poses such as [Pigeon pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/media/originals/2845-32.jpg), [High Lunge](http://www.yogajournal.com/media/originals/HP_209_05_LRG.jpg), [Warrior II](http://www.f8imagestudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/warrioryoga.jpg), etc.
  * Many teachers have different philosophies on different poses and practices. I mentioned to Ai that I have an issue (I am not quite sure what it is) where my [left shoulder won&#8217;t wrap as well as my right shoulder](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=wrapping+shoulders+yoga&um=1&hl=en&biw=1268&bih=626&tbm=isch&tbnid=pysBc8jfAlFt1M:&imgrefurl=http://gofitgirl.com/%3Fp%3D5645&docid=zScwc9jzJNMAdM&imgurl=http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/warrior-I.jpg&w=2048&h=1536&ei=UCz1TqDeJdHbiAK8yKzFDg&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=190&vpy=157&dur=464&hovh=162&hovw=219&tx=100&ty=111&sig=113828507499778522129&page=1&tbnh=133&tbnw=183&start=0&ndsp=19&ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0) does. Â (I went to Google and searched for [wrapping shoulders yoga](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/warrior-I.jpg) and the first image to pop up was from Go Fit Girl! Oh yea!) Ai said she doesn&#8217;t believe in wrapping shoulders, which I have heard from some teachers before as well.

Ai&#8217;s class was amazing. I think a lot of the students enjoyed the class as we were letting the studio owner know that her class was amazing and they need to have her as a regular teacher.
