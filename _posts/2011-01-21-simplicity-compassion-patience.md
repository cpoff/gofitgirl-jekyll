I love Happy Hour Yoga with Ken. We do about 55 minutes of regular yoga practice and then 10-15 minutes of restorative yoga. It&#8217;s a great way to end the workweek. This week wasn&#8217;t too tough&#8211;though there were still some long hours involved. But that is getting a little better as I now have someone working with me.  
As we began our yoga practice tonight during mediation Ken usually has us set an intention&#8211;which I love doing, sometimes I set my intention toward someone else and sometimes for me. When Ken was mentioning our intention he also mentioned our practice was about simplicity, compassion and passion.  
What a great way to end the workweek.
