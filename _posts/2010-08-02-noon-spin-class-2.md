Work is getting crazy &#8230; again.  
But I know I gotta get to the gym when I can. I made sure I could get there today. I took the noon spin class today.  
I always feel better after I take the noon spin class during the work day. Especially today. I didn&#8217;t sleep well last night and was just tired and super busy and stressed at work.  
The second half of my day was much easier after hitting the gym for a good and hard work out.
