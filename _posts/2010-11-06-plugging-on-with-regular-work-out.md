I slept badly last night. My sleep patterns are weird&#8211;I will slept decently for a week or two and then not sleep well for a week or two. Sometimes the better sleep lasts longer, which lately it has. But this past week I seem to wake up a lot. I have no problem falling asleep. But I wake up a lot. And this past week I wake up and don&#8217;t feel tired.  
It was pretty bad last night and I woke up exhausted. I still went to the gym. Spin class was so tough. I decided to go to abs class and skip body conditioning. But I ended up doing the whole two hours. I came home ready for nap and unfortunately no nap ever happened.
