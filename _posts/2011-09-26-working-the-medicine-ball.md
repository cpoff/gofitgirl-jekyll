[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6658" title="medicine ball" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/medicine-ball-300x277.jpg" alt="Medicine ball photo provided by Teach Me Fitness." width="300" height="277" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/medicine-ball.jpg)Today I did about an hour of climbing on the espinner. After my ride I did 15-20 minutes of stretching, weights and squats and abs with the medicine ball.  
Until recently I had never really used a medicine ball.  
Today I did [squats with a 6-pound medicine ball](http://cdn.sheknows.com/articles/Medicine_ball_squat.jpg) and when I stood up I [held the ball high above my head](http://shapeupwithkate.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/p10100231.jpg). After 20 of those I did some [oblique twists](http://www.coreexercisestudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/medicineballtap.jpg).Â I did 15 to the left and 15 to the right.  
When I used Google to search for medicine ball images I found [a lot of exercise ideas with the medicine ball](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&sugexp=pfwc&cp=19&gs_id=27&xhr=t&q=medicine+ball+squat&qe=bWVkaWNpbmUgYmFsbCBzcXVhdA&qesig=wYzcsQc-AZKt2MUBaW7IpA&pkc=AFgZ2tku7TiU6yYeIOWeUuJiU2KgtIJiKGVW61HWtkLdDEYvM0NnmPZWyoY4bIbuQoP1Tk406m9x7mQxvvO9BDTtz8nD-B55AQ&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&biw=1268&bih=626&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi#um=1&hl=en&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=medicine+ball+obliques&pbx=1&oq=medicine+ball+obliques&aq=f&aqi=&aql=1&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=3204l4437l0l5024l7l7l0l6l0l0l118l118l0.1l1l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&fp=f6a5050f56a55c1&biw=1268&bih=626). I am sure there are a ton more than what is in that link.  
I plan to try some other exercises. Of course, if I come up with some good stuff I will share it all here on Go Fit Girl!
