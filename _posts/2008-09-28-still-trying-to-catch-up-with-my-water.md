The weekends are usually the hardest for me to maintain a good amount of water intake. Through in some travel and it is even worse. Add in a party with lots of beer and just forget it.  
I woke up this morning with a headache and feeling very parched. After some Advil and a little water I started to feel much better.  
I definitely didn&#8217;t drink enough water this weekend. And my goal is when I drink for every drink I have I have a serving of water. Mmmmm, that didn&#8217;t happen.  
Our friends Don and Kristin had an amazing Oktoberfest party at their place last night. Great food, including dessert, and lots and lots of beer.  
I do have to say I got some exercise in with some dancing.  
(Oh, and, unfortunately, no workout this morning. Being dehydrated is no fun. And I slept horribly. So I decided to sleep in and make up for it.)
