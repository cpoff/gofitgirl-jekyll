    Pigeon pose, my favorite hip opener.

In Baxter&#8217;s Hatha Yoga class tonight we worked a lot with the hips. About half the class we were lying down&#8211;my kind of yoga. Though we were definitely working.  
Pigeon Pose is my favorite hip opener. I forget about the many other ways to open the hips.  
Today we did an &#8220;extreme&#8221; [half Happy Baby pose](http://www.fitsugar.com/Strike-Yoga-Pose-Half-Happy-Baby-275678).  
[Happy Baby](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2497) is probably one of my least favorite poses. It&#8217;s a difficult pose for me to do. It really works the hips for me and is a great opener. But I find it uncomfortable to the point where I feel stuck. I have to be very careful when coming out of the pose.  
We also did a [lunge hip opener](http://fitnessformommies.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/hp_209_05_lrg.jpg).  
The two poses were putting our bodies into the same positions. Just one on our back and the other on our feet. It was an interesting way to look at it and practice.  
I have a feeling my hips will be sore tomorrow &#8230; but in a good way.
