  <strong>Yoga is for all men, women and children, irrespective of race, sex, language or religion. Yoga, after all, aims at a union of individual consciousness. &#8230;&#8221;</strong>

On Friday I attended a one-day conference at Berkeley called [Yoga and Access: Questions of Inclusion Conference](http://www.raceandyoga.com/yoga-and-access-questions-of-inclusion-conference.html).  
Topics that were discussed were how yoga can be (and has been) brought to underserved communities, yoga and capitalism, Orientalism, cultural appropriation, universalism, White femininity, social justice, healing, unrealistic ideas of the &#8220;yoga body,&#8221; trauma, body celebration, religious and cultural symbols, authentic yoga &#8230;  
There were so many good conversations that got started (and will hopefully continue at the second annual conference). So many things to think about. So many ideas to ponder.  
Once I am certified as a yoga teacher (just two months away!) I want to teach to the masses.  
But I also have a passion to share my skills and practice in other ways.  
Part of my teacher training includes observing and assisting with the teachers in the program. I have been able to O&A in classes for people with Parkinson&#8217;s. When I am in attendance I feel happy and grateful to be part of something like that. It&#8217;s part of my calling.  
I have ideas about how to bring yoga to an underserved community of a program Curt and I support financially in Oakland.  
Getting certified as a yoga teacher is just the very beginning of this adventure I am about to take on.
