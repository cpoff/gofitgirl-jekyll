I haven&#8217;t been able to attend my regular Tuesday afternoon yoga classes lately. We have a new teacher. I really liked Suraya.  
But I have to say Sean is a great teacher. I like his style. His class was challenging and a great workout.  
I was trying to convince him to take over the Friday morning yoga class. They are looking for a teacher for that class to replace wonderful Ajaia. Anyone want to apply?  
I am trying to get Hilda to take that class over. But I doubt the distance from where she and my dad live to my gym will be worth it to her. Dang!
