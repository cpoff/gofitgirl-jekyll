    My yoga teacher training requires a big commitment on my part. I have already had to decline a variety of social activities because this is my priority right now.
  </p>

I have been thinking a lot about priorities lately. About what is important for me and to me. And what makes me happy. (Don&#8217;t forget about [Do you want to be happy?](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/08/do-you-want-to-be-happy/))  
One of my friends/co-workers told me that something I said to her lately really hit a chord. And she suggested this be a Monthly Challenge.  
I love ideas, suggestions and questions that lead to posts of any kind. So let&#8217;s try this for Go Fit Girl&#8217;s October Monthly Challenge.  
What is a priority in your life? What is important? If something is really important you will make a commitment to it.  
We all have excuses for why we don&#8217;t have time for something, right?  
Choose a focus/commitment for the month. You, of course, can choose more than one. But don&#8217;t overwhelm yourself.  
You can make a commitment to eat healthier; eat at least one fruit and one vegetable a day; get to the gym at least three times a week; do something that makes you happy (don&#8217;t forget about that [theme we are working on for the rest of the year](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/08/do-you-want-to-be-happy/) and was part of [September&#8217;s Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/09/september-monthly-challenge/)); learn a new craft; get back into your favorite jeans or sexy leather skirt; take a class you have always wanted to take (academic, crafty, toward a degree, something new to learn or enhance); start exercising; drink more water; volunteer with an organization you&#8217;re passionate about; lose weight; join a political campaign; try yoga, Pilates, spin, Zumba, etc.; read a book; start a garden.  
The options are endless. Your commitments don&#8217;t have to be strictly diet and exercise. The focus should be toward your well-being, which covers so much in our lives.  
Remember all those challenges you posted for [Comment Contest Tuesday](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/09/comment-contest-tuesday-11/), which was part of [September&#8217;s Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/09/september-monthly-challenge/)? Why not take one (or two) of those challenges and make a commitment to it for this Monthly Challenge?  
When it was announced in yoga teacher training recently that a yoga home practice should be committed to five times a week for 45 minutes I first thought, no way! I can&#8217;t do that. I am making the goal a little smaller initially and am committing to a home practice five times a week for 20-25 minutes and will work up to the 45 minutes.  
Here are my recent commitments:

  * Take on yoga teacher training 10-month program (which includes classwork, yoga classes, home practice, readings, homework, etc.)
  * Maintain the Go Fit Girl! blog with posts three times a week
  * Back to healthy lifestyle in terms of caloric intake (regular exercise is pretty constant in my life)
  * Yoga home practice five times a week (which means most days I am getting up at 5 instead of 5:30 for the home practice)
  * Going to bed a little earlier to accommodate the early morning home practice
  * Utilizing my time on the shuttle bus ride to and from work to write posts for the blog and to get in some yoga teacher training reading homework
  * This commitment started yesterday &#8230; I am working on not letting anyone, including myself, diminish my light.

And we all probably spend too much time on Facebook, the Internet, playing Candy Crush (I&#8217;ve only heard that this is time suckage&#8211;I&#8217;ve never actually played it). Of course, you still want to make a little time to read Go Fit Girl&#8217;s blog and check in on the [Monthly Challenge Facebook group page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594110353966116/), right?  
Feel free to posts your commitments, progress or whatever you want to say about this challenge in the posts below or on the G[o Fit Girl! Monthly Challenge Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594110353966116/).
