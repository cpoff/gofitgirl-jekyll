I recently bought the [Tap & Track app](http://www.macworld.com/appguide/index.html?lsrc=twt_amw) for my iPhone. So for the past week I have been tracking calories I consume and calories I &#8220;earn&#8221; with exercise. The idea is similar to what I was doing with Weight Watchers. I just decided to try something new. Plus I always have my phone with me.  
In a week I lost 3.6 pounds. I think part of that is a fluke&#8211;since last Monday (Oct. 19) when I weighed in was the morning after sushi. Though I did drink A LOT of water all day Sunday.  
I will write more later about how much I love this Tap & Track app.
