    I took care of my back tonight and focused a good amount of time in Child&#8217;s pose.

Today during my Vinyasa yoga class I thought about what Vickie, one of my yoga teachers, says to the class when she puts us into a challenging pose &#8230; I&#8217;m not interested in you hurting yourself or I am not interested in you hurting your _insert body part here_.  
I have [kyphosis](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/kyphosis/DS00681). One time in a yoga class the teacher told everyone that old people have kyphosis, which can be true. But I have it, too. I have a slight curvature of the upper spine, which can give me lower back pain. I have weak back muscles and a weak core. A strong core makes for strong back muscles. I continue to strive and work on both.  
In class tonight we focused a lot of work on our lower backs. Eventually I really started to feel it in my back. So I took a step back and focused Â on not hurting myself and taking care of me.  
I gave my back and body and mind extra time in Child&#8217;s pose tonight. And Lily, the yoga teacher tonight, came over and helped me get deeper into the pose. She has an amazing touch and is training to be a massage therapist. So delicious!  
Things as simple as cleaning the house or doing laundry can put a lot of strain on my lower back. I know when to take a break or step back.  
Taking care of me has to be a priority in all aspects of my life.
