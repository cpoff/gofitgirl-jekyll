If you didn&#8217;t take the chance to visit us while we&#8217;ve lived in the Bay Area unfortunately for you, it&#8217;s too late.  
After being in the Bay Area for almost 10 years Curt and I are taking the plunge and moving to Portland in mid-January.  
It’s exciting and scary. I have lots of good friends here and have established a great yoga community. That will be hard to leave.  
Talk about a lot of big decisions and changes in my life lately. Totally taking myself out of my comfort zone.  
It has been our goal for years to get back to Portland. It&#8217;s where we want to settle. We will actually be able to buy a house one day, which just isn&#8217;t possible for us in the Bay Area.  
I love the Bay Area and all that it represents (except for earthquakes). I have made a lot of amazing friends and that&#8217;s what I am having a hard time saying goodbye to.  
The yoga community I have developed is also something pretty special. I feel lucky to have made so many friends through yoga. And many of my regular yoga teachers also taught me how to be a yoga teacher.  
But the opportunity has come upon us and this is the time to take it. It&#8217;s sooner than I thought it would be. But that&#8217;s life.  
Besides missing friends and the yoga community and the amazing Bay Area I will miss BevMo. In Oregon, you have to buy your booze at state-run liquor stores. I might have to learn how to make limoncello.  
But I won&#8217;t miss paying sales tax or pumping my own gas. I can&#8217;t wait to be able to shop again at Freddies (Fred Meyer) and Winco.  
We have lots of good friends in Oregon and some special, close friends in Portland. And I already have connections to make with fellow yogis/yoginis in Portland.  
It&#8217;s bittersweet to leave. But I think it will be a good move for us.  
Thanks East Bay: Berkeley and Oakland for letting us live in your fine cities. And on to another fine city I will be happy to call home.
