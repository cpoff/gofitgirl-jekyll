We got home from Las Vegas today. We flew out on Wednesday night. We had a great time and with our friends Jen and Dave, too.  
When I go on vacation or out of town or whatever I usually know that the healthy eating goes out the window.  
Sometimes I can keep the outrageous caloric intake to a minimum. Other times the options are limited or I just don&#8217;t want to.  
This long weekend I didn&#8217;t want to. I wanted to eat crap and delicious food and drinks lots of beer and some fuu-fuu drinks as well with a little wine in there, too.  
Hanging out at Ellis Island Casino makes it easy to eat and drinks lots with their Dollar Madness Menu: $1 beers (larger beers were a whole 2 bucks); $1 hot dogs and 5 wings for a buck.  
And hanging out watching basketball for hours is, of course, better with beer and bar food!  
The couple of times hanging out at the pool I was either having beer or yummy fuu-fuu high calorie frozen drinks.  
Having dinner and endless wine at [Battista&#8217;s Hole in the Wall](http://battistaslasvegas.com/) is a must visit every time we go to Vegas. The food is amazing, not too expensive, the coffee they serve is amazing, the endless house wine &#8230; The four of us enjoyed our meal there last night.  
I was so proud of myself for making it to the gym three mornings over the long weekend. I did roughly 45 minutes to an hour each day. Cardio, weights, abs &#8230; That stair climber thing was an ass kicker. The sweat was pouring. It was great!  
Most of the times when I pack gym clothes when on vacation the clothes never make it out of the suitcase. Not sure what my motivation was this time around but it was there and I ran with it.
