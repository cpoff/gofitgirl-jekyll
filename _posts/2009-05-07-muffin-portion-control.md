I watched four episodes of [Cook Yourself Thin](http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/shows/cook-yourself-thin) last night.  
There are all kinds of great tips and ideas and recipes to try out. But the one that has been mentioned twice and really stuck with me is when making muffins.  
Use an ice cream scooper. This controls the portions and also keep the muffins even. Pretty genuis, eh?
