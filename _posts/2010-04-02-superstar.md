](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/march-stars.jpg) Twenty-three stars in the 31 days of March.  
Every time I work out I get a star on my calendar. It&#8217;s a nice little mini reward. And I am proud of myself when there are many to display. That calendar hangs in my cube at work. So once in a while someone asks what the stars are for.  
My stretch goal is 6 days a week. That, obviously, doesn&#8217;t always happen. So my realistic goal is 4-6 times a week. Four times a week is not shabby. Six times is awesome and I am rock star!
