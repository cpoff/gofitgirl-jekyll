I have been visiting friends this weekend in Phoenix.  
I have gone on two walks with Erica and Baby Finn. (Though Erica says they were lollygag walks.)  
But the food department has been a little crazy. Friday night at the airport before I flew out I munched on Cheese & Penne and some wine. A new wine bar, Vino Volo, opened in the Oakland airport.  
I have to say I have had some yummy food while here: Eggs and salami; burger at George & Dragon (and lots of Smithwicks); yummy egg sandwich; fried chicken; and mac and cheese.  
Eh, I will be back on track soon enough. Hope everyone had a good weekend.
