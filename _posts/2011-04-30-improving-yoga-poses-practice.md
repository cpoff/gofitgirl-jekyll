Yup, another yoga post. Who knew I could write so much about yoga?  
I have been practicing yoga semi-regularly for about four years now. There are poses that I feel I have made vast improvement with and others that come more easily. And there are those that are still difficult for me to do.  
Until yesterday I didn&#8217;t realize I had been doing [Upward Facing Dog](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/474) incorrectly this whole time. Once Kristin, my [Forrest Yoga](http://www.forrestyoga.com/about/philosophy.php) instructor, pointed it out I made the correction. And I have to say it is much more intense and difficult than it was before.  
I love that I am always learning something more about the practice of yoga, myself and my capabilities. I credit this to taking a variety of yoga classes with a variety of instructors.  
The classes I am regularly taking right now are [Hatha Yoga](http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/hatha.htm), [Vinyasa Yoga](http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/vinyasa.htm) and [Forrest Yoga](http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/forrest.htm). I would also like to regularly add the [Restorative Yoga](http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/Restorative-Yoga.htm) class as well.
