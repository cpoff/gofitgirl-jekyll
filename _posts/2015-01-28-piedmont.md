There are so many great things about taking yoga classes, especially at a studio. Establishing a yoga community is such an important part of the practice.  
While in Oakland I regularly took classes from two yoga studios.  
Piedmont Yoga Studio is where I did my yoga teacher training and also took classes from teachers who were also teaching me how to be a yoga teacher.  
On Saturday Piedmont Yoga Studio will close its physical doors.  
In 1987 Piedmont Yoga Studio was founded by Rodney Yee, Richard Rosen and Claire Finn.  
Until recently I regularly took classes from Richard. In November I took a master yoga class with Rodney Yee and his wife Colleen Saidman when they were in town. And earlier this month I took a class with Claire Finn. I told her after class that I had to make sure I took yoga classes with all three of the original Piedmont founders.  
Piedmont will become &#8220;a studio beyond walls that is open and accessible to all.&#8221; You can [read more about that here](http://www.piedmontyoga.com/#!new-programs---studio-beyond-walls/c10lm).  
Even though I was only part of the Piedmont community for a little more than a year I have an attachment to it, what it represents and the people I met and the friends I made.  
I decided to do my teacher training at Piedmont for a variety for reasons. Because of the [history and reputation](http://www.piedmontyoga.com/#!history/cvte) of the studio I wanted to study there. Two of my regular yoga teachers studied there years ago and taught at Piedmont and at the other studio where I regularly practiced. One of the three founders, Richard Rosen, still taught at Piedmont and was part of the teacher training.  
I had no idea how difficult and amazing the program would be. I learned so much about my practice and myself over the 10-month program. And I continue to grow as a yoga practitioner, yoga teacher and a human being.  
My experience helped me realize it was time to leave my corporate job and pursue other things.  
I am so grateful for the chance to teach at a gym in Alameda for an extended period of time while the regular teacher was on maternity leave. And I also decided to get my SPINNING® certification and was able to teach five indoor cycling classes at my gym before the move.  
And here I am sitting in my living room in Portland, Oregon &#8230;
