    This photo isn&#8217;t really about fruit, but it&#8217;s cute and funny. I like fruit and knitting. I knit hats for babies in the NICU. And I like nectarines, which is wearing the blue tiny hat.

I love and eat lots of fruits and veggies. Besides that they are delicious and good for you and me they are quite filing, which can really help when you are trying to lose or maintain weight.  
I have noticed recently that by the end of my work day I feel bloated and bleh. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why this was the case since I have been eating rather healthy.  
Last week when I was in Tucson my eating habits were a little different. I had very few fruits and a little bit more vegetables.  
But I realized at some point I hardly ever felt bloated, even after the heavy Mexican meal or the sugary [strawberry eegee](http://www.eegees.com/).  
Last night I started to think that maybe the many fruits I am eating daily are the culprit.  
I decided to try to minimize my fruit intake today. I feel a little better today. Before today most work days I would eat anywhere from three to seven servings of fruit a day. That&#8217;s a lot. But I love fruit and need something to snack on. So I need to try some more veggies in place of some of the fruit.

    Nothing is more delicious than fresh fruit.

According to [Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/512582-fruits-that-wont-make-you-bloated/), too much fruit at one time can provide bacteria in your gut with a foundation for fermentation that results in gas production and bloating in your lower abdominal region. Fruits such as cantaloupe, honeydew melon and green, seedless grapes contain less soluble fiber than other fruits. Raspberries, blackberries, pineapples, bananas and watermelon are also recommended and have less fiber.

<div>
   The above linked Livestrong article mentions fruits that cause bloating and fruits that don&#8217;t as does another <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/31966-list-foods-make-feel-bloated/ ">Livestrong article</a>, which also contributes to the information above and below.
</div>

The fruit that can cause bloating includes apples, strawberries, apricots, prunes, blueberries, peaches, pears, prunes and sweet cherries, which are high in soluble fiber. The article mentions that these listed fruits should be eaten in moderation if bloating is your primary concern.  
The morning smoothies I have been making for breakfast have strawberries and blueberries. I also add a banana.  
My goal will be to try to focus on the less &#8220;bloatable&#8221; fruits. I am kinda bummed at my realization. But it is what it is. I just need to make some adjustments and change things up. Everything we eat and drink has to be about moderation as well.
