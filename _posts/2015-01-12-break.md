And not a Ross/Rachel kind of break.  
As GFG! and The Husband getÂ ready for the big move this week I need to focus on the last bit of packing and all that comes with it &#8230; including the stress and OMG! Am I going to run out of time before Thursday arrives? UGH!  
There will be one farewell post (likely posted on Wednesday) before we jump into the Subaru and drive up I-5.  
And I promise once we are set up in our new place in Portland I will be back with regular posts of my new adventures.  
So don&#8217;t be a stranger. Feel free to peruse the blog and find many past posts for your reading enjoyment.  
And if you want to read the top two posts on GFG! &#8230;  
Almost every day multiple people read about [removing toothpaste from clothing](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/05/removing-toothpaste-from-clothing/). (Thanks to Monica P. for asking about that. It&#8217;s my top read post. I regularly check my stats to see what people are reading and looking for.)  
The second most read post asks, [should you drink alcohol when you are sick?](http://gofitgirl.com/2011/04/should-you-drink-alcohol-when-you-are-sick/) Because that one was so popular (used to be No. 1) I [reposted it](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/02/sick/) the last time I was sick.  
You can also find me on Facebook: [personal page](https://www.facebook.com/chihak) and [GFG! page](https://www.facebook.com/GoFitGirl). And you can find [GFG! on Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoFitGirl).  
I will be back soon and posting from the Northwest.
