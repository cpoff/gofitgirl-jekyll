And just like that, it&#8217;s September.  
The month of September is National Yoga Month.  
According to [Yoga Health Foundation](http://www.yogahealthfoundation.org/yoga_month), September is National Yoga Month (a national observance designated by the Department of Health & Human Services) designed to educate about the health benefits of yoga and to inspire a healthy lifestyle.  
I am parterning with [Athleta in Washington Square in Portland](http://stores.athleta.net/store-4642/) as a YogiFit Pro. I will be at Athleta on Friday, September 18th from noon to 2 p.m. to answer questions about yoga. (I will likely have a little bit more information to share about this event soon.)  
According to [the site](http://athleta.gap.com/browse/info.do?cid=77993&mlink=55287,8574355,16&clink=8574355), Athleta is a retail store, which outfits female athletes with the ultimate performance apparel and gear while: Inspiring an active lifestyle. Motivating others. Tapping into our collective power as a group.  
The studio I teach at, [Turtles Yoga & Wellness](http://www.turtlesyoga.com), has some fun stuff planned during this month as well.  
Yoga Health Foundation lists [10 reasons to practice yoga](http://www.yogahealthfoundation.org/images/uploads/documents/YM_10Reasons.pdf) (text courtesy of [Yoga Alliance](https://www.yogaalliance.org)):

  1. Stress relief
  2. Pain relief
  3. Better breathing
  4. Flexibility
  5. Increased strength
  6. Weight management
  7. Improved circulation
  8. Cardiovascular conditioning
  9. Focus on the present
 10. Inner peace

If you can&#8217;t make it to the Athleta event, feel free to comment below asking me any questions you may have or e-mail me at ann@gofitgirl.com. (It also could inspire a future post.)
