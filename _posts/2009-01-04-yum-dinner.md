I have recently discovered a great frozen shrimp and veggie stir fry at Safeway. [Safeway has their Eating Right line of foods](http://shop.safeway.com/superstore/default.asp?mainurl=/corporate/safeway/eating_right.asp&navurl=/superstore/leftbar/lft_wellness.asp&pn=save), and this is one of them. It comes with a sauce of some sort, which I don&#8217;t use.  
I am making the veggie stir fry and brown rice for dinner tonight. I spray the frying pan with a little Pam and then throw in the stir fry. I add garlic powder and [Weber&#8217;s Kick &#8216;N Chicken](http://www.weber.com/bbq/pub/shop/product/view.aspx?ProductID=1209).  
It is a really filling and delicious meal. Very low in fat and calories. I make this about once a week for dinner.  
My dinner is almost ready so I am going to go eat.
