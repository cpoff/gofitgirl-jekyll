That&#8217;s what one of my fellow kickboxing classmates said to me when we were working on a partner ab exercise. Thanks!  
Person A lies down, feet up in the air while person B stands above A near their head. A holds into B&#8217;s ankles while B pushes hard on A&#8217;s feet. A&#8217;s job is to keep legs straight and in place. And if not A must use their core muscles to pull the legs back in place.  
Does that make any sense?
