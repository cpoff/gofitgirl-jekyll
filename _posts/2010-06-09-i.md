I went to Zumba class again tonight at my gym.  
That class is definitely fun. And it is a great workout. I think I was a little better today than last week, which was my first time at Zumba.  
Heidi is keeping it pretty basic for now. Which is plenty for me. I am a little slow at getting steps down in dance classes or step or anything of that sort. But even with the basic steps I get sweaty and feel the cardio working.
