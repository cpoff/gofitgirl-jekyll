Lifetime TV (one of my favorite channels) started airing a new show last night called [Cook Yourself Thin](http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/shows/cook-yourself-thin).  
Two half an hour episodes aired. They showed real women who were eating way too many calories. They took their favorite foods, [such as pizza, lasagna, burger, cupcakes, etc.](http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/shows/cook-yourself-thin/recipes) and showed them a much healthier and tastier way to make the same foods for so many fewer calories and less fat.  
And the women lost weight!  
I am so getting [the cookbook](http://www.everywomansvoice.com/?q=node/648) and I love the show.  
Check it out. [Full episodes online](http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/shows/cook-yourself-thin/video).
