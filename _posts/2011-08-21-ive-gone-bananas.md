    Bananas are yummy, inexpensive, healthy and filling. Great as a snack or part of breakfast.

Today&#8217;s post is all about bananas.  
Bananas have been an integral part of my life lately. For some reason I have been eating a lot of bananas&#8211;mostly with my breakfast.  
I usually have this bad habit of buying bananas and never eating them and then they go bad and I have to throw them away. (Or actually throwing them in the compost.)  
In Sunday&#8217;s Vinyasa class the past two Sundays we have done a pose called Banana, which I had never heard of until last week or had done it before last week either.  
The Sunday Vinyasa class I attend regularly is a heated class with lots of flows to get us heated up and sweaty. Before [savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482) we usually do one [Yin Yoga](http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/580) pose. Today we did [Banana](http://www.yinyoga.com/ys2_2.0_asanas_bananasana.php). It&#8217;s a great stretch and a rather comfy position to be in.  
Here are a few facts about bananas, the fruit: A medium-sized banana has about 100 calories, 3 grams of fiber and not even 1 gram of fat. According to [About.com](http://nutrition.about.com/od/fruitsandvegetables/p/banans.htm), bananas have 422 mg of potassium. According to the [University of Maryland Medical Center](http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/potassium-000320.htm), potassium isÂ a very important mineral for the proper function of all cells, tissues, and organs in the human body. It is also an electrolyte, a substance that conducts electricity in the body, along with sodium, chloride, calcium and magnesium.
