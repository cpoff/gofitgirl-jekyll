Over three days I took five yoga classes. I Â am definitely putting that unlimited membership to good use.  
Oh, and I got a second yoga bingo today. I had to turn my card in for a drawing and was given a new one. I had two yoga bingos, so I am entered in the drawing twice and I still have until the end of the month to earn more bingos.  
Since I worked from home on Friday, I took a morning [Vinyasa Flow](http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/vinyasa.htm). The class was taught by a sub. I like the regular instructor. But the sub was great, too. In the Vinyasa Flow classes at some point the instructor usually wants to create some heat. In Friday&#8217;s class, Katie had us do our own Vinyasas, which I thought was pretty cool.  
Yesterday, I took three hours of yoga. Two classes in a row: [Vinyasa Flow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEDlkBi8uwI) and [Hatha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_yoga). I felt really amazing afterward.  
Today I tried an [Ashtanga](http://yoga.about.com/od/ashtangayoga/a/ashtangs.htm) Flow class. I had never taken Ashtanga class before today. And I just came back from the [Restorative](http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/991) class.  
[This link](http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/yogatypes.htm) gives a short description of the various types of yoga.  
I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to try so many types of yoga. Some I really like, some are just OK. Most of the instructors are great and some are just OK. [Namaste&#8217;s](http://namasteoakland.com/) schedule allows me to find the classes and instructors that fit best for me. And with my unlimited membership and the encouragement of Yoga Bingo I am trying so many different classes and instructors.
