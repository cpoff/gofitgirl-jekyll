(For those of you who watch Parks & Rec that headline should make sense. For the rest of you, ewww! Get your mind out of the gutter!)  
I had off from work today. Took cousins to the airport this morning. Then had a lazy, loungy coffee morning. Then I headed to the noon spin class at the gym. My Saturday spin teacher has been teaching the noon Monday spin class lately.  
It was a good class. It was tough. But it always is.
