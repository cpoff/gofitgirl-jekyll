    Brown rice, roasted seaweed snacks and Rooster sauce make an easy, fairly healthy and yummy dinner.

I left the house this morning about 6:15; got to work at 7:15; worked until about 4; headed down to the gym at about 4:15 and jumped on the 5:35 shuttle bus; got back to Emeryville about 6:35; headed to Target and then the grocery for Thanksgiving shopping and shopping for a small party we are hosting this weekend for my gym friends.  
I got home a little after 8:15 &#8230; more than 15 hours after my day started.  
I am sure you wanted to read all of that, right?  
It is a little before 9 and I am just sitting down to eat and blog and watch TV. Yes, I must multi-task. It&#8217;s the only way I can get anything done these days.  
Man, I am so freakin&#8217; tired. But I wanted to eat.  
I heated up some brown rice (I had pre-made in the fridge), grabbed some [roasted seaweed snacks](http://www.amazon.com/Trader-Roasted-Seaweed-Snack-Packs/dp/B003VG0MYY) and my bottle of [Rooster sauce](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_3KKq5dis8yA/SoDjLTolMVI/AAAAAAAAAQA/FqwMgQ719LE/s400/Rooster+Sauce.jpg). (I also had this for dinner last night as I didn&#8217;t get to eat until about 8 and still had to blog, get my clothes and gym bag ready for the next day.)
