So my exercise routine is good. My goal is to work out 4 to 6 times a week. Lately I have been hitting 5 to 6 times a week.  
I, like [Jen](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=2814), want to get back on track.  
For me I really need to reel myself in in the food department.  
I make it a point to work out often. But today I had a &#8220;revelation.&#8221; I realize this is common sense &#8230; but I need to stop sabotaging my weight maintenance (and actually I want to lose a few pounds) by eating whatever crap I want.  
Whenever I get off track in the food department I say what the hell! I will eat whatever I want. That is so the wrong attitude to have.  
So one day was a screw up. Big deal! Tomorrow is a new day.  
And lately I have really been eating WHATEVER I want. So bad. It isn&#8217;t that I am having a little &#8220;cheat&#8221; here and there. It is that since I am &#8220;off plan&#8221; (Weight Watchers) I can eat whatever I want.  
That is gonna change. A lot of it is accountability. And the fact that the scale at the gym is messed up doesn&#8217;t help me. I think well, I have no idea what my weight is &#8230; Anyway, I could start using my cheap Target scale at home and make myself have more accountability.  
And I need to start eating better, tracking my food and making better food choices.  
I will check in and let you know how I am doing.
