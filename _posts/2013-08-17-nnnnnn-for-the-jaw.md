    Saying Nnnnn is simple. Try it while driving, while exercising, before going to bed, while watching TV &#8230;

About two months ago [I talked about my TMJ disorder](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10766) acting up. It first triggered when I had braces. Now it resurfaces when I am stressed.  
It is still lingering. I figured when I was in Turks & Caicos for a stress-free week of relaxation it would go away. It did briefly.  
On Tuesday in Vickie&#8217;s Hatha yoga class she mentioned her own TMJ disorder.  
Her dentist told her if she said Nnnnnn and held her jaw in that position that that is the perfect placement for your mouth, jaw and tongue and will relieve discomfort or pain.  
I, of course, had to do my own research. Both articles I link to mention Nnnnn for the jaw. Holding the jaw this way allows the teeth to come apart while relaxing the jaw muscles.  
One of the [first articles](http://www.health.arizona.edu/health_topics/general_health/sorejaw.html) I came upon came from my alma mater, University of Arizona&#8217;s Campus Health, where my mom worked and retired from and where I worked as a student worker for about two years.  
Diet, sleeping habits, oral habits, applying heat and ice, medication and exercises are all addressed.  
[Metro Dentalcare](http://www.metro-dentalcare.com/patientinformation/aftercareinstructions/tmjjawpain.aspx) suggests tips for self-care for jaw pain.

  1. Apply moist heat or cold to the joint or muscles that are sore.
  2. Eat a pain free diet.
  3. Chew food on both sides of your teeth at the same time or alternate sides.
  4. Keep your tongue up, teeth apart and jaw muscles relaxed. (Nnnnnn)
  5. Avoid caffeine.
  6. Avoid oral habits and activities that put strain on the jaw muscles and joints.
  7. Keep head up, chin in and shoulders down and back.
  8. Learn and practice relaxation and abdominal breathing.
  9. Avoid events that trigger the pain.
 10. Get a good night’s sleep.
 11. Use anti-inflammatory and pain reducing medications.

Feel free to read both articles as they go into detail.  
Happy jaw muscles! Nnnnnn
