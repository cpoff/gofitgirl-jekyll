After more than a month away from spin I went back tonight. The class was tough, but not as difficult as I thought it would be. It was a good work out.  
My getting back on plan hasn&#8217;t been as on plan as I would have liked. But I will get there. One step at a time.  
Work has been very busy and food is being brought in. The temptations are hard for me to resist. And I tend to eat crap when I am stressed.  
Work will continue to be rather busy. But I want to make me (work/life balance) a priority. I will be working hard and long hours. But I will also work on keeping as healthy of a lifestyle as possible.
