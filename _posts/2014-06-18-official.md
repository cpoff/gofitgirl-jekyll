In **EIGHT** days I will be a certified yoga teacher.  
This has been a long journey at Piedmont Yoga Studio&#8217;s Deep Yoga teacher training: 10 months of school, homework, yoga classes, observing and assisting, weekends, Thursday nights &#8230;  
Days after I graduate I am heading to my hometown of Tucson to have some R&R, visit family and teach my first official yoga class as a certified yoga teacher at [Mindful Yoga Studio](http://www.mindfulyogatucson.com).  
My class is called Do Good While You Feel Good, a donation class to benefit [Tucson&#8217;s Community Food Bank](http://communityfoodbank.com).  
Here is a [link to the event invite](https://www.facebook.com/events/267971743388406/) on Go Fit Girl&#8217;s Facebook page.  
This event is open to anyone. Please invite your friends. It will be great support to me, Mindful Yoga Studio and the food bank.  
I have learned so much over these past 10 months. And now it is time to put them to practice. It will likely be a little rocky at first. But the more I teach, the easier and better it will get.  
I&#8217;ve already been working on the class I&#8217;m planning to teach. It&#8217;s part of my home practice. I think it will be a great beginner practice or gentle practice.  
One of the poses I will be teaching is pictured above. Do you know the name of it? In Sanskrit? In English?  
For my East Bay/Bay Area friends, stay tuned &#8230; I will be teaching a class with a partner next month. I will post that information soon.
