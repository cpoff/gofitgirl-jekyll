    Two things I keep around at work and home: raw almonds and plenty of water.

A friend recently asked me if I had any tips on how to eat healthier. She may regret that she asked.  
Just a reminder to my readers &#8230; I am not a doctor, nutritionist or personal trainer. This post and all of my posts are based on personal experience and my own research.  
So here we go:  
It takes time to break old habits and form new good habits.  
Drink lots of water. I try to drink at least 64 oz. of water a day. Yes, you will pee a lot. But that&#8217;s the point. You are cleansing yourself.  
I recommend keeping a food journal. My weight loss and healthy eating is most successful when I am tracking my food. I am not saying you have to join Weight Watchers. Though if you are asking for advice on losing weight I would definitely recommend WW. Regardless the food journal keeps you honest, accountable and makes you aware of what you are putting in your mouth.  
Always eat breakfast. Eat something that will keep you full and satisfied. High protein and fiber foods keep you feeling full longer. My regular breakfasts are: oatmeal with fruit; Kashi cereal; Sara Lee Delightful bread toasted with a banana and peanut butter; light mutli-grain English muffin with a poached egg and a piece of turkey bacon. If you don&#8217;t have time for breakfast (I eat my breakfast when I get to work) at least grab a banana or apple for the car ride, bus ride, train ride to work.  
Things I like to snack on: fruit; raw almonds; dates; raw veggies, cheese, roasted seaweed.  
A lot of my lunches and dinners consist of brown rice and veggies.  
Things I regularly eat are: brown rice; whole wheat pasta; beans&#8211;kidney, garbanzo, black beans; chicken breast; high-protein salads (blue cheese, chicken, kidney and garbanzo beans, tuna and a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar); fish; cheese; lots of veggies.  
If you drink soda regularly, try to cut back. If you have four sodas a day, cut it down to two. Eventually you can cut soda (including diet) out of your diet all together. I rarely drink soda these days and have it more as a treat occasionally.  
Read labels. Check on your intake of fat, calories, sodium, carbohydrates, protein and fiber. The more protein and fiber the fuller you will feel. (I am on a protein kick right now so I am gonna keep pushing that. Now, in the past and I will in the future as well.)  
I personally hate cooking. But I have found easy things to make and eat, which are healthy and filling. I am an advocate of easy. I will have a Lean Cuisine occasionally. But I have cut back and started cooking more. If you can find simple and healthy meals you will feel better, too. Seasoned steamed and boiled veggies over brown rice are easy and delicious and filling. I have said this before, the best 20 bucks I ever spent was on a rice cooker at Target, which includes a tray for steaming veggies.

  Â And when you are ready, start introducing exercise. Start slow and easy &#8230; (That will be for another post another day).
