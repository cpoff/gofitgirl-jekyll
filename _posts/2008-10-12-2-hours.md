I worked out for two hours yesterday. For someone who doesn&#8217;t like working out too much that is damn good.  
Saturday mornings I take spin. Then after that my spin instructor teaches a half an hour abs/core class. With the new fall schedule a sculpting/conditioning 30 minute class was added after abs/core, also taught by Jennifer. So I stayed for that class, too.  
My arms are sore today. I still can&#8217;t believe I worked out for two hours.  
But it meant I could eat all my pasta last night for dinner. (It didn&#8217;t mean I could eat all of my pasta for lunch today. But I did anyway.)
