    My gym bag was packed and in the trunk every day this week.

Monday was my day to get back on the healthy living wagon.  
No excuses.  
The cafe at work always has healthy options for breakfast and lunch.  
(Curt and I were out of town over the weekend so I didn&#8217;t have a chance to get to the grocery store.)  
Having the work cafe means I have lots of good options to choose from as well as deliciously bad ones, which I successfully avoided.  
I have packed my gym bag every day and kept it in my trunk. This means if I get back too late to take a regular class whether at the gym or yoga studio I have exercise clothes with me and I can do a workout on my own at the gym.  
(I would rather take a class, but that doesn&#8217;t always work out.)  
Even on a hectic and stressful day like today I kept pretty good with my food intake. I did have an excuse for not exercising: I worked a 12-hour day and didn&#8217;t get home (after more than an hour commute) until 9 p.m.  
And I will hit yoga tomorrow.  
I really wanted a drink when I got home tonight. But I decided to keep my alcohol-free workweek going until tomorrow night.  
I am proud of myself for maintaining my healthy routine this week. Because I could have easily ditched it.
