Curt and I took a walk today to head out for lunch. (Oh, by the way, we are in San Diego for a few days for some relaxation.)  
Curt said it would take up about 15 minutes to get where we were going. (He walked it last night.) But I don&#8217;t walk as fast as my husband. It took about 30 minutes. We found the Sandbar and had some beer and lunch (nothing I had was healthy&#8211;well, except for the tomato and lettuce on my burger).  
The sun went behind the clouds so it was much cooler walking back. We decided to walk on Mission sted of the boardwalk&#8211;not so windy.  
So I got an hour walk in. I am sure there will be more walking tomorrow.
