We are out of town this weekend. Good ol&#8217; Portland, Oregon.  
It is tough to keep up with a healthy lifestyle when not at home.  
But I did check beforehand if our hotel had a gym. It does.  
I just came back from the little gym. Just three cardio machines and three weight machines. But better than nothing.  
I have never been a fan of the stair stepper. But the treadmill was in use and I really didn&#8217;t want to do the bike (tho. I could have pretended I was in spin). The stair stepper ended up being a great workout. I burned more than 200 calories in 30 minutes and climbed 226 floors! Unfortunately there was no where for my trashy celebrity news to go. And I was a little worried because my iPod was in the red of the charge. I didn&#8217;t bring a charger. So tomorrow I will have to use my iPhone. I think I can handle that.  
We are meeting friends for brunch in a bit. I plan on trying to stick with maybe some egg whites and fruit salad as the rest of the day will be a challenge in the food department.  
Last night we met our friend Angela for dinner at [Montage](http://www.montageportland.com/). I had my spicy mac. It is so good and so unhealthy!
