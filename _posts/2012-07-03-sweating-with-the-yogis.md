    I had to make sure to have a towel under my head today whenever doing Child&#8217;s pose as the sweat was literally dripping off of me and onto my mat.

I realize my blogging has been minimal lately. I am either too lazy to blog or too busy. One extreme or the other. No fear&#8211;I will get back into my flow, soon, I hope.  
Because tomorrow is a holiday, today it was a half day at work. So I worked from home.  
Because of my early day I was able to attend [Sean](http://namasteoakland.com/yoga/instructors/sean-michael-hall)&#8216;s 4:30 Vinyasa class. I rarely get to take his class because I just can&#8217;t be there on time.  
His class is always challenging, always sweaty and always pushes me. But at the same time he encourages his class to listen to their body and take a break when needed.  
Sean&#8217;s class today was probably the sweatiest I have ever gotten in a yoga class. And I have taken many sweaty yoga classes.  
I was sweating so much that it was getting in my eyes and up my nose. I told Sean I had trouble breathing because the sweat was going right up my nose. His response, I take that as a compliment.  
He did mention to us at the end of class that he wished he could give us the 10-15 minute [savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482) we earned and deserved. But with Vickie&#8217;s class starting at 6 it just wasn&#8217;t doable.  
Sean told us to take it easy tonight and maybe meditate a bit before bed. I will definitely take it easy tonight. Hopefully I will remember to meditate a little as well.  
No matter how hard one pushes themselves it is important to remember to take care of oneself. Relaxation is important and not lazy. It&#8217;s important to maintain balance in life. So many of us feel guilty for not taking care of ourselves. As [Vickie](http://namasteoakland.com/yoga/instructors/vickie-russell-bell) mentioned on Sunday, our inner mean girl comes out. And this mean girl is just mean to &#8220;me.&#8221; I am getting better at ignoring her. But that is still a challenge for me as well.
