    It takes a lot of will power for me to NOT eat a doughnut, let alone multiple doughnuts.

The other day at work THREE boxes of thank-you doughnuts were delivered to members of my team. And they were shared. I didn&#8217;t indulge. But that&#8217;s not what this post is about.  
Somehow the topic came up that it was &#8220;healthier&#8221; (not to be confused with healthy) to eat a doughnut than a bagel.  
So, of course, that inspired research and a post.  
[According to FitDay](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/doughnuts-vs-bagels-which-is-the-healthier-breakfast-option.html), while bagels only seem healthier because they are not deep-fried like doughnuts, they are surprisingly unhealthy as a breakfast option and may, in fact, even be unhealthier than doughnuts.  
FitDay says, aÂ typical doughnut, such as a simple glazed doughnut, already brings with it 229 calories and 25 grams of carbohydrates. &#8230; One basic, plain bagel has 215 calories and 42 grams of carbohydrates. The real shocker about bagels is their extremely high sodium content. (Nutritional content various on the bagel and doughnut depending on what site I was looking it.)  
I did a little extra research on the sodium content in a plain bagel. I got various answers. Anywhere from 620mg in a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts bagel to as low as 470mg.  
The glazed doughnut and plain bagel are pretty basic items. If you add filling, sprinkles, chocolate, cream cheese, etc. the calories, carbs and fat (and sodium) greatly increase.

From an [opinion piece on The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/25/opinion/essay-bagels-vs-doughnuts.html), doughnuts are sweet and crumbly, with more than 10 grams of fat; bagels are chewy and low in fat. Doughnuts are fun, with sugary smiles, sales peaking at Halloween; bagels are serious, ethnic and harder to digest.  
[Cluck Bucket](http://www.cluckbucket.com/alternate/doughnut.htm) does a comparison of a glazed doughnut from Dunkin&#8217; Donuts vs. plain bagel. The difference in calories and carbs is astonishing.  
The thing is if I eat a doughnut it will be gone almost immediately and I will still be hungry. If I eat a bagel it takes time to eat it and I will stay full longer. (But let&#8217;s also not forget about the cream cheese we want to add to that warm, chewy, toasty bagel.)  
I love both doughnuts and bagels. I mean, they are delicious. And aren&#8217;t most unhealthy things delicious?  
My breakfasts vary from oatmeal to eggs and bacon to cereal to toasted peanut butter and banana sandwich to fruit and yogurt to egg white scramble &#8230;  
And I eat breakfast every day. It&#8217;s the most important meal of the day. And make sure if has lots of fiber and, yup, you guessed it, protein. They keep you full and feeling full longer.  
And yes, I do indulge in a bagel, muffin, scone, doughnut, restaurant breakfast occasionally. But that&#8217;s the thing, it is only occasionally.  
And if you REALLY want a bagel or a doughnut, then have one. Just don&#8217;t do it too often.  
Or Thomas makes a great alternative to the bagel: Bagel Thins. One Bagel Thin is 110 calories; 1g fat; 210 mg sodium; 25g carbs; 4g fiber; and 4g protein. Instead of cream cheese try a Light Laughing Cow Cheese Wedge at 35 calories; 1.5g fat; 180mg sodium; 1g carbs; and 2g protein.
