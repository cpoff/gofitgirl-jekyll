I am trying to get [Erica](http://www.ericakern.blogspot.com/) to write a guest post about why she LOVES spin. Because I seriously don&#8217;t get it. And she is gonna be busy soon, Baby O will be here soon.  
So help me encourage Erica to write something up. ðŸ™‚  
Anyway, spin has been so much tougher than usual lately. The classroom in the evenings is so hot! On Tuesday I walked in and was sweating and I hadn&#8217;t even gotten on the bike.  
We can&#8217;t open the door anymore. It is an emergency door and an alarm will sound.  
So the gym got us a tornado fan. But so far I have not felt anything from that fan. On Tuesday I noticed it was on but pointed at the teacher. And the instructor HAS a small little fan right by the bike that cools them. (Oh, and I was in the front row that night.)  
Today I got to class right at 6 p.m. and the only bikes left were in the back row (there are three rows of bikes). I hate sitting in the back for many reasons: it is difficult to hear and see the instructor and the cooling factor is about nil back there.  
The tornado fan was on today, but man, that just didn&#8217;t help me. My row had a fan pointed at us. But that didn&#8217;t help at all either.  
But I survived the class and feel good that I did. I always feel great after spin class. I just hate actually taking part in the class.  
Oh, and being in the back row pretty much forces you to look at the clock&#8211;which does NOT help you survive the class.  
I was happy to pound away on the pedals to old school Michael Jackson: [Wanna Be Startin&#8217; Somethin&#8217;](http://www.allmichaeljackson.com/lyrics/wannabestartinsomethin.html). I have the Thriller album on vinyl. I used to play it on my Popeye the Sailorman record player. Yea baby!
