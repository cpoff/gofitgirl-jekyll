&nbsp;  
Sometime last week I decided to put myself through a cheese intervention.  
Yup, the cheese eating has gotten out of control. I love cheese. I love hard cheese, soft cheese, stinky cheese, strong cheese, mild cheese, fake cheese. You get the idea.  
At work, one of the snacks offered are [Babybel cheese](http://www.thelaughingcow.com/products/mini-babybel/): Gouda, Bonbel, Original and Light. They are way to easy to eat and delicious and easy to grab one or two or three &#8230;  
Last week when I realized I needed to stop eating so much cheese I would only have one or two Lights a day. (If I do cardio I need some protein on the shuttle bus ride home.) It was under control last week.  
I don&#8217;t know what happened this week. But the cheese eating definitely increased.  
The Laughing Cow also makesÂ [cheese wedges](http://www.thelaughingcow.com/products/the-laughing-cow-wedges/). The light wedges are only 35 calories. (The Light Baybel is 50 calories.) The wedges can be eaten alone, spread on a cracker or even melted into a meal. We have the wedges in our on refrigerator at home.  
I do pack my lunches almost every day and include healthy snacks. So, what&#8217;s the issue? I think it is just this &#8230; I love cheese. So I just need to learn to say no more than yes.
