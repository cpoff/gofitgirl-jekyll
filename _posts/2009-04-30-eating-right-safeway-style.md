If you shop at Safeway I am sure you have seen their [Eating Right line](http://www.safeway.com/IFL/Grocery/EREatingRight-About).  
For some time now I have been buying the [Shrimp Stir Fry](http://www.safeway.com/IFL/Grocery/CategoryDisplay?catalogIdentifier=EREatingRight&identifier=ERMultiServeEntrees&startIndex=10&currentPage=1). It is so easy and healthy. Spray a pan with a little Pam and throw in the stir fry. I also have it with brown rice. It comes with some sort of sauce, which I don&#8217;t use. I use garlic powder and [Kick&#8217;n Chicken](http://store.weber.com/items/GrillCreations/Detail.aspx?pid=1208&cid=225229&subCat=1). Curt likes the stir fry, too. I use the Kick&#8217;n Chicken on all kinds of stuff. Sprinkle some on pasta with a little olive oil and garlic. Yummy!  
The other day while at the grocery I was grabbing a bag of the stir fry I noticed a [Chicken Fajita Stir Fry](http://www.safeway.com/IFL/Grocery/CategoryDisplay?catalogIdentifier=EREatingRight&identifier=ERMultiServeEntrees&startIndex=0&currentPage=0). I decided to buy it. Curt and I had it for dinner last night. It was really yummy. (I even have a little leftovers for lunch today.) It comes with a powder to add a little kick. I always need a little more kick and smothered my stir fry with [Rooster Sauce](http://www.huyfong.com/no_frames/sriracha.htm). We eat our fajita stir fry with corn tortillas.  
Good stuff!  
When I looked up Eating Right I noticed they have a huge line of food. They seem pretty reasonable in the calorie and fat categories. Check it out!
