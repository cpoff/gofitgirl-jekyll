At the launch of the new year I made a decision to not continue Go Fit Girl&#8217;s Monthly Challenges. At least in the temporary as I had to give up something in all the things I have going on.  
That being said, I am still trying to occasionally come up with a quickie challenge here and there on [Go Fit Girl! Challenges Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594110353966116/).  
And I thought since I have a few going on I would do a post about them so my readers who aren&#8217;t on Facebook could get (and even give) some ideas.  
I did write about [The Jar Project](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/01/positive-experiences-jar/), which is a year-long experiment for myself. When something good happens, which I am grateful for I put it in the jar. Such as seeing a beautiful sunset; an anonymous person left a parking paid stub for me to use so I didn&#8217;t have to pay for parking; I got to visit my family for a long weekend in Tucson; getting a much-needed massage and day to relieve myself of exhaustion. OK, you get the idea.  
Another Challenge I posted was to work on giving up a bad habit for the month of February. Trying it for a day, a couple of days, a week or the whole month. Obviously you can take this challenge into March or any month you like.  
The most recent challenge posted was to give up Social Media for a day. I had been thinking about trying this out. And one day I realized I had gone a considerable amount of time without looking at Facebook or Tweeting on Twitter so I decided to hit the 24-hour mark and went to about 27 hours. And all was still OK with the world.  
If you have ideas for challenges I would love to hear them and use them. How do you challenge yourself?
