Well, that and booze.  
I love it when I am able to hit the noon spin class on Mondays at the gym. I try to make the time for it every Monday, but that doesn&#8217;t always work out.  
Today I was able to go. Usually after class I feel refreshed and ready to take on anything. I felt that way initially returning to work. But today was just a crazy busy day. So that &#8220;high&#8221; didn&#8217;t last long.
