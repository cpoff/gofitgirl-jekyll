[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4347" title="IMG_1315" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_1315-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_1315.jpg)I worked out in the new swanky gym at work today.  
The gym is about 75% set up. I was the only one in there the whole time I was spinning.  
For about 40 minutes today I worked out on the [eSpinner](http://www.spinning.com/spinning-shop-spinner-bikes/spinner-bike-eSpinner.asp). There is a video of a guy on a bike telling me what to do, encouraging me, etc. The actual bike monitors what you are doing and will tell you if you need to go faster or slow or add or take off resistance.  
I choose an endurance routine. It was tough and a good workout. The back of my thighs and the lower part of my butt are slightly sore. I can only imagine how they will feel tomorrow. There were other spin routines to take&#8211;strengthening, climbing, endurance, etc. I plan to try all routines.  
The work gym has treadmills, ellipticals, spinners, weight machines, free weights, medicine balls, stability balls, towel service and a big TV.  
I think the best part is the built-in fan. I get so hot when I workout. The built-in fan is so great.  
I am still trying to figure out my workout routines and schedule. I am also trying to figure out if I can fit my regular gym into this mix. The yoga studio will be no problem. I have a few classes I know I can make and enjoy.  
Today I went to the gym about 4, worked out and then just went home in my exercise clothes on the 5:30 p.m. shuttle.
