As I had predicted posting would be minimal this week.  
I meant to at least post saying my grandpa&#8217;s surgery went great. The doctor got the whole tumor out and was able to get all the parts back together.  
My dad, aunt and I got to visit with him about an hour after her surgery. And he looked remarkably well.  
I have been visiting him in the hospital multiple times a day. Yesterday I was there three times.  
I&#8217;ve been trying to help my dad as much as possible. My dad had to go up to Phoenix today for work. So in a little bit I am taking the pooch to doggie day care. Then a visit to grandpa. Then picking the pooch up. Then (hopefully) lunch with my grandma. Then a visit with my mom. Whew!  
I am so happy I made the decision to come home for this. (It all could have turned out much differently and I wanted and needed to be here either way.)  
I am coming up with some post ideas while here in Tucson. I hope to research and post one or two ideas this coming weekend. So stay tuned. And thanks to everyone for the good thoughts and well-wishes.
