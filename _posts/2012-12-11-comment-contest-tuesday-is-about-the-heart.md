In honor of Go Fit Girl!&#8217;s [December Challenge of the Heart](https://www.facebook.com/events/171269159682849/) this Comment Contest Tuesday is dedicated to that and helping others. If you would like to read the original post, [please go here](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9919).  
Years ago both sides of Curt&#8217;s and my families decided to stop giving each other Christmas gifts. Everyone has what they need and for the most part, what they want.  
There are so many people who are so much less fortunate than we are. And we want to help them and make Christmas a little better for them.  
In the past Curt and I have donated to [Brighter Beginnings](http://www.brighter-beginnings.org), [Pajama Program](http://pajamaprogram.org/WordPress/), [Heifer International](http://www.heifer.org), [Planned Parenthood](http://www.plannedparenthood.org), [Charity Choice Gift Cards](http://www.charitygiftcertificates.org) among others.  
We are doing something different this year. But I can&#8217;t tell you about it as some of our family members read the blog. But I am excited about this one and promise to share later on.  
What are you doing for the Heart Challenge?  
A reminder of the December Heart Challenge: Grab an Angel from a tree; run a toy drive; buy a toy (or toys) for a toy drive; deliver toys to needy children. Or find some other worthy cause you want to support.  
Every person who comments will get their name thrown into a drawing for a chance to win a Charity Choice Gift Card stocking stuffer, which you can keep for yourself or pass on to someone else.  
You have until noon (my time&#8211;Pacific) next Monday, Dec. 17 (which just happens to be a special person&#8217;s birthday) to comment. And for your comment to count you have to comment in the comment section below. Comments on Facebook, replies to Twitter, e-mails don&#8217;t count.  
And if you want to know who the winners were for last week&#8217;s Comment Contest Tuesday, [click here](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9981).
