    Ananda Balasana (Happy Baby) was one of the poses I worked on with my &#8220;students.&#8221;

Over the weekend Curt and I were in Missouri visiting his parents for our annual deer season trip. If you want to read more about that, you can [go here](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/11/venison/).  
I have practiced yoga with friends and family before where I am essentially instructing. But it is usually just one-on-one.  
On Saturday late afternoon, my mother-in-law, Marilyn, and I did my [calming, curbing sadness practice](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/11/sad/). We both felt pretty Zen afterward.  
On Sunday two friends, Donna and Heather, came over and practiced with us.  
It was the first time I taught my first mini yoga &#8220;class.&#8221; My &#8220;class&#8221; had a variety of ages, flexibility, parts of the body with injuries or care needed. And everyone was a beginner. So it was the perfect opportunity for me to practice my &#8220;teaching.&#8221;  
And I bet no one can say they have ever taught or taken a yoga class with the smell of venison jerky in the making looming in our &#8220;studio&#8221; (aka basement).  
About a week ahead of time I asked my &#8220;students&#8221; if there was anything in particular they wanted to work on. Some of the requests were core and low back pain issues.  
I centered my practice around those and tried to keep it for beginners, yet still challenging.  
We did what I called an easy Sun Salutation (aka Sun Salute) with some core work and some back strengthening poses. This v[ideo on Gaiam Life with Rodney Yee](http://life.gaiam.com/video/sun-salutation-how-rodney-yees-yoga-beginners) is a great example and instructions for beginners in Sun Salutes.  
The easy Sun Salute I did with my &#8220;class&#8221; was similar to the video linked above, but we also added a lunge, low lunge or runner&#8217;s lunge, depending on what everyone was comfortable with and a plank and cobra. This [illustrated step-by-step](http://yoga.about.com/od/yogasequences/ss/sunsalutesteps.htm) is the Sun Salute we did with the beginner suggestions.  
I felt it was a good start after my first &#8220;class.&#8221; But I know I have a ways to go. And as with yoga you continue practicing. And I feel the same with teaching.  
So … if anyone is willing to be my guinea pig or how about guinea yogi/yogini? I am planning on sticking around the Bay Area over the winter holiday break. We can figure out where to meet up and practice together and then maybe get lunch or a drink or coffee or whatever.  
(I may be in Tucson in January, so that is a possibility as well … I will keep you informed.)
