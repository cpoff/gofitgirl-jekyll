    Showing off my flu shot spot.

Today my company hosted a flu shot clinic.  
For all eight years it has been offered to me I have taken advantage of the convenience and the free shot. I absolutely hate shots and needles.  
But I like my health more than I hate needles. So my wienie self sucks it up.  
Other jobs have offered the free flu vaccine as well and I have always taken advantage of it.  
There are some people who don&#8217;t want to get the shot or won&#8217;t. I respect that.  
But what I ask my friends and loved ones and even those I don&#8217;t know or have never even met who refuse the shot, when you are sick, please stay home and don&#8217;t bring your germs to work (or anywhere else where you can avoid spreading your cooties).  
I realize the flu shot doesn&#8217;t cover all strains.  
And it doesn&#8217;t help prevent the common cold, which for some reason many people I have encountered believe this misconception.  
The [Mayo Clinic posts some facts I want to share](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/flu-shots/ID00017) with you:

  * Flu shots are the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications.
  * According to the CDC, in past flu seasons when the match between flu vaccine and circulating strains of flu virus is close, a flu shot is between 60 and 70 percent effective in warding off influenza in all age groups combined.
  * After vaccination, your immune system produces antibodies that will protect you from the vaccine viruses.
  * The flu vaccine can&#8217;t give you the flu.

Whether or not you get the vaccine, take care of yourself during this cold and flu season.  
Regularly wash your hands. If you can&#8217;t wash your hands, use hand sanitizer (I keep some in my purse and at my desk at work). Clean your work desk, cell phone, keys, anything you touch and are in contact regularly with Clorox or Lysol wipes.  
If you are sick, stay home. Don&#8217;t share your germs. Plus you will get healthier quicker if you let your body rest.
