Friends, today I turned 40.  
I have no issues with being 40. In fact, I am excited about it.  
I have looked forward to this day for many years.  
I have always looked much younger than I actually am. So I like shocking people with my true age. Just the other day someone told me they thought I was in my 20s.  
Plus, years ago I decided my 40th birthday trip would be in Tahiti. And tomorrow Curt and I head off to Tahiti for a week! Eeeekkk! Can&#8217;t wait.  
(For Curt&#8217;s 40th birthday trip we hit Oktoberfest in Munich. We also visited Budapest and Prague and had dinner with friends one night in Vienna. And had a chance to visit our German &#8220;family&#8221; in Stuttgart. That was a great trip.)  
I remember when I thought 40 was old. Let me tell you kids &#8230; it isn&#8217;t.  
For a long time in my early adulthood life was challenging. But that molded me to be the person I am today.

So far I have lived a fulfilling life. I have had to work hard for everything I have and everything I have done. And I am proud of that.  
Today I am sporting a shirt that says: Made in 1974. 40 years of being awesome. (Check out the [Facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/awesomewomen1974).)  
A few months back I found an article titled, [10 things no one tells women about turning 40](https://medium.com/@hollyseymour/10-things-no-one-tells-women-about-turning-40-8d7c582ef795).  
Some great take aways from the article:

  * &#8230; You turn a corner and start feeling comfortable in your own skin. &#8230;
  * You go to bed when you are tired. &#8230;
  * You become resilient. &#8230;
  * You remember to tell people that you love them. &#8230;
  * You have a close knit circle of amazing friends. &#8230;
  * And the best one of all: You don’t have to buy into the cultural messages that you get bombarded with about getting older. It is all crap. Being 40 is awesome.

OMG! What was I thinking?  
I started out as a journalist, working as an editor at two different newspapers; then took a leap of faith and moved to the Bay Area with The Husband (who had gotten a good job) with no job and got lucky with a chance to prove I could learn new skills and work in the legal department of a biotech for 9+ years.  
And now I am starting a new chapter.
