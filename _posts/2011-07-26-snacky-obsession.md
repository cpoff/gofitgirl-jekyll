    My Trader Joe's purchase today of 15 packs of Roasted Seaweed Snack.
  </p>
</div>

  
Lately I have been having some major cravings for Roasted Seaweed Snacks from [Trader Joe&#8217;s.](http://www.traderjoes.com/index.asp)  
They have become my latest snack obsession.  
[](http://www.traderjoes.com/index.asp)I was at Trader&#8217;s last week and bought four packs. They went quickly. I kept thinking about those things today. When I got back to Emeryville after the shuttle bus ride I headed directly to TJ&#8217;s to get some more seaweed snacks. They had a decent amount in stock so I thought I better stock up myself as they don&#8217;t always have them.  
So I bought 15 packs. They are only 99 cents. So how could I not stock up?  
They are vegan and gluten free&#8211;neither matters to me. But does to some, so I thought it was worth mentioning.  
If you eat the whole package, which is very easy to do, it is only 60 calories, 4 grams of fat, 2 grams of fiber and 2 grams of protein. There are just 4 ingredients: seaweed, sea salt and two kinds of oil.
