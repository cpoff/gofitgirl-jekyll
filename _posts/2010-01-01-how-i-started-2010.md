My goal was to hit the gym this morning.  
Uh, didn&#8217;t happen. Mostly because I didn&#8217;t sleep well and a champagne headache doesn&#8217;t help. Being lazy was a good excuse.  
So instead today I stayed in my jammies and watched Lifetime movies and SVU marathon and read.  
Starting on Monday I am detoxing and going back to my healthier lifestyle. I have some challenges ahead of me. But I have some plans to help me through it.  
Stay tuned for my updates. Also check back on Tuesday, another Comment Contest Tuesday is coming up. Don&#8217;t miss it.
