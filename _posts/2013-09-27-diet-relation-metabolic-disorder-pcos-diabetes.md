Today’s guest post is written by Dorothy Pang, the Natural Fertility Expert.  She’s a healthcare expert who&#8217;s helped hundreds of people to make healthier choices in their life, boosting their health, energy and fertility.  
You can read more information about her at the bottom of this post.  
What is PCOS?  Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, PCOS is a condition that affects many women.  It can lead to infertility.  When a disease condition is referred to as a syndrome, that means that it is not very clearly understood by Western medicine.  
PCOS seems to be related to metabolic disorder, and to diabetes.  Metabolic disorder, and PCOS could be seen as intermediary steps on the way to diabetes.  If a body with either of these conditions is left untreated, the patient is at a higher risk for developing diabetes.  
I like to explain that diabetes happens when the spleen and pancreas (spleen and pancreas are seen to work together as a unit in Traditional Chinese Medicine) blow a gasket.  They have been overworked and just plain poop out.  Unfortunately for the patient, there is no way to replace this gasket, and in severe cases only oral medication can help.  
However, there is a LOT that can be done to help to keep the body in balance if we get the to problem BEFORE the point where it’s full-blown diabetes.  In some cases of milder diabetes as well, this can work: dietary changes.  You see, for the body that has PCOS, metabolic disorder, or is pre-diabetic, lifestyle choices play a huge role in the progression or healing pattern of that disease.
