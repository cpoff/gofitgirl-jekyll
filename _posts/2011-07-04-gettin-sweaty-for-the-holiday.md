For the holiday, Namaste had just one class today. The normal Monday 10 a.m. class was held today, which I can&#8217;t normally attend because of that work thing. It was Power Vinyasa.  
Wow, I thought the Forrest Yoga class on Friday was hot and sweaty. But class today was the sweatiest yoga class I have taken.  
It was a good class. There was a lot of movement and it was tough. Those are the best kind of classes.  
Now I can eat my tacos and drink my beer later with less guilt. ðŸ™‚ (The parents of one of our friends who recently got engaged is having an engagement party later today. No barbecue today&#8211;but tacos. We are OK with that. Yum!)  
Today marks Day 13 of exercise in a row. Let&#8217;s see how long I can go before I break the trend. I do believe you need a day off from exercise. And I do strive to work out 4-6 times a week, always hoping for 6 times a week with a day off. But I feel good with my schedule right now.
