    Since I don&#8217;t have any pictures of the food sent to our friends today I am posting a pic of my dinner.

I feel like cancer is affecting so many people I know and care about.  
One of my friends, who is younger than I am, is battling testicular caner.  
I think we can all agree that cancer just sucks!  
My friend lives in Oregon. Curt and I are showing support as much as we can even though we aren&#8217;t nearby.  
One of my friends set up a meal online sign-up sheet with [Take Them a Meal](http://takethemameal.com). It&#8217;s a meal coordination where basic information can be shared about the meals needed for the recipient(s) and others can see who is taking care of dinner on what day and what they are bringing.  
I, of course, can&#8217;t hand deliver a meal. But the site offers meal delivery services. So by today my friend and his family should have had a meal delivered from us.  
I plan to sign up a few times to deliver meals as his chemo continues.  
This website can be used to coordinate meals for anyone you want. For someone who is sick, for someone who just had a baby, for someone who just underwent surgery, for someone who is going through chemo &#8230;  
It&#8217;s easy to create a meal schedule. According to the website one can create a customized online sign up sheet to include phone numbers, driving directions, food allergies and more that makes it easy for friends and family to take meals to those in need.  
Adina and Scott (founders of the site) started [Take Them a Meal](http://takethemameal.com/story.php) in December 2007 when a friend got sick. The phone rang day and night because family, friends and neighbors wanted to help by bringing meals to her husband and four young children. They felt overwhelmed by the task of coordinating meals, but they wanted to help and knew the meals were needed. As a result, they designed a site that eliminated the need for making and receiving time-consuming phone calls.  
Besides the meal scheduler and meal delivery the site has [tips](http://takethemameal.com/tips.php), [recipes](http://takethemameal.com/recipes.php), [blog posts](http://takethemameal.com/blog/index.php) and a [pretty large FAQ page](http://takethemameal.com/help.php).  
I know our friend and his family are going through a difficult time right now. And we are sending good thoughts there way along with an occasional meal.
