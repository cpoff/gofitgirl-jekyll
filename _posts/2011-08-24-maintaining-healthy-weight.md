Over the past couple of weeks I have had at least three comments that I am shrinking, dwindling away, losing weight, looking skinny, etc.  
I didn&#8217;t really feel like I was dropping weight. I wasn&#8217;t sure since I hadn&#8217;t been on a scale in weeks, maybe a month.  
So today I got on the scale &#8230; don&#8217;t worry I am not withering away. I am about 2 1/2 pounds from my goal weight. This was a surprise to me.  
My exercise is in excellent practice. I am working out on average 6-7 days a week. My water intake is really good. I drink on average 80-96 ounces a day. I have almost completely cut out soda&#8211;diet soda included. I am trying to only drink alcohol on the weekends (Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays).  I am doing OK in that department. My caloric intake is just OK. It could be better. So I was surprised that my weight was lower than expected.  
I know how to lose weight and I know how to maintain. My willpower with food is weak at times.  
When I was losing weight I was doing it a healthy way. I counted Points® with Weight Watchers. Between advise from my doctor and working with my WW leader we decided on a healthy weight. Yet people still felt the need to make comments about my weight. People told me they hated me; I didn&#8217;t need to lose weight; I didn&#8217;t need to lose anymore weight, etc. Anyway, I know the healthy way to lose it and will maintain the knowledge I received years ago.
