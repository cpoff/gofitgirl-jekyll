That is what Baxter announced today as we began our practice. Tonight&#8217;s practice was more therapeutic, which I needed after a hectic day, long commute home and a hurried rush to class tonight.  
We did a lot of twisting tonight, which really focuses on the digestive system. According to an [article on the Yoga Journal web site](http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/817): There are physiological benefits to the circulatory system and internal organs, structural benefits to the musculoskeletal system, and focusing benefits to your consciousness.  
Baxter asked us to see how we feel tonight, how we sleep and how we feel in the morning. I am hoping for a good night of sleep. Lately, Joey (furbaby) has been all clingy at night. He used to just sleep at our feet. But now he sleeps on my stomach, back, chest or right next to me curled into my chest. I already have a hard time sleeping. But I love my furbaby and want to encourage his cuddly ways as they won&#8217;t last forever.

This seated twist pose (which we didn&#8217;t do tonight) has so many benefits:

  * Stimulates the liver and kidneys
  * Stretches the shoulders, hips, and neck
  * Energizes the spine
  * Stimulates the <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/health/1230_1.cfm" target="_blank">digestive fire</a> in the belly
  * Relieves menstrual discomfort, fatigue, sciatica, and backache
  * Therapeutic for <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/views/1177_1.cfm" target="_blank">asthma</a> and infertility
  * Traditional texts say that Ardha Matsyendrasana increases appetite, destroys most deadly diseases, and awakens kundalini.

That one pose does all of that. Isn&#8217;t that incredible? (Pictured to the right.)
