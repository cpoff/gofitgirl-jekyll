    Getting in at least 48 ounces of water a day.
  </p>

One of my goals every day is to drink enough water. I don&#8217;t really have a goal every day. But I need to drink at least 48 ounces a day. I usually have 64 ounces a day. Sometimes more.  
My body can definitely tell when I haven&#8217;t had enough water. Now that I have as much as I do I can&#8217;t go without.  
I believe it varies on how much each individual should drink. I have heard that a person should drink at least half their weight in ounces of water. So if you weigh 150, you should drink 75 ounces of water a day.  
I also believe the more caffeine and alcohol imbibed means the more water that should be taken in.  
A friend of mine recently started drinking more water. He commented that he had to visit the restroom what seemed to be about every 15 minutes. How he resolved it? He stopped drinking so much water. I told him, nooo.  
The more you drink water the more you have to pee. It&#8217;s a fact. But that means your body is self-cleansing. That&#8217;s a good thing.  
On Saturday&#8217;s I normally exercise for two hours. Between spin class and abs I fill up my water bottle and I visit the bathroom: Filling up and emptying out. That&#8217;s what my friend Julia and I say to each other as we pass each other in the hall.
