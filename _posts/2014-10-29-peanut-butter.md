Have you seen the 40-year-old Virgin?  
Remember FRENCH TOAST? (Here&#8217;s a [clip of that scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snR96EgWDVI). Swearing is involved. So you&#8217;ve been warned.)  
Ha ha!  
Anyway, years ago Curt and I were watching some diner or cooking show and someone made peanut butter and banana French toast.  
It sounded amazing. The version they made was super unhealthy.  
I decided to take a stab at it with a healthy spin to it.  
I don&#8217;t make a lot of breakfast. But I made this recipe recently and thought it would be a good idea to share.  
Here&#8217;s my version of peanut butter and banana French toast:

  * 2 slices Sara Lee Delightful wheat bread
  * 1 tablespoon peanut butter (I prefer creamy, but for this recipe crunchy works better)
  * 1/2-1 banana
  * 2 tablespoons egg whites
  * 1 tablespoon fat free milk

The ingredients listed are for one serving. Double or triple ingredients for extra servings.  
I like to smoosh the banana onto my bread. Other slice I spread the peanut butter.  
Dip &#8220;sandwich&#8221; into the egg whites/milk.  
Use cooking spray oil in the pan. Grill it up and enjoy!  
You get some protein and a fruit. It&#8217;s yummy. And melty heated up peanut butter is delish!

Since I shared a peanut butter recipe above I thought I would share a second one, a yummy and easy snack.  
Sometime back I [wrote about the peanut butter energy balls](http://gofitgirl.com/2012/03/handing-out-peanut-butter-energy-balls/) I made and shared at work.  
Here’s the recipe again, in case you want to try it yourself:  
1 cup regular oatmeal  
1/2 cup peanut butter (I added about 3/4 cup.)  
1/3 cup pure, unfiltered honey  
1 cup coconut flakes  
1/2 cup ground flaxseed  
1/2 cup chocolate chips (or craisins or raisins or another sweetness of your choice)  
1 or 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract  
Using your hands, mix all the ingredients well in a bowl.  
Let it chill for at least 1/2 hour in the fridge.  
After the mixture is chilled, use a teaspoon to size out scoops of the mixture and roll into balls.  
They will keep in Tupperware in the fridge for seven days.  
Enjoy!
