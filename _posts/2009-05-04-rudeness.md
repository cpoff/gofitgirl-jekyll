On Monday and Wednesday morning I take a yoga class at my gym. Before the 7:15 a.m. class is a body conditioning class. The teacher is pretty much always running late and yoga doesn&#8217;t normally start until about 20 after the hour.  
I don&#8217;t think that instructor gives his students time to stretch at the end of the workout. When the class is over people leisurely walk out, while others are still stretching.  
Today there was a woman who was kinda in my regular yoga spot. I set my mat near her and went to get a blanket, strap and blocks (things you need to practice yoga). When I came back she was still stretching. Just taking her time like it wasn&#8217;t rude and there wasn&#8217;t another class about to begin.  
That is so not the way I want to start my yoga practice. But whatever. At least she finally left.  
It ended up being a good class.
