    The scarf I have been working on for my friend Monica.

Today my goal was to not eat any bite-sized Snickers from my candy bowl at work. I was tempted many times. But every time I longingly looked at the candy I reminded myself of my goal. And I was successful. Just a little will power.  
I had planned to do an hour and a half at the work gym&#8211;an hour of cardio and then weights and abs.  
But all day today I have had a headache. I just couldn&#8217;t kick it. I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was a sinus headache or because I was dehydrated or something else. I drank a decent amount of water yesterday. But not as much as I normally take in.  
I thought it was best to skip the gym and take it easy this evening. I exercise almost every day. So I don&#8217;t feel guilty skipping today. Every body needs to rest at times as well.  
This evening I have been relaxing, watching TV, movies, cuddling with the furbaby and knitting. I haven&#8217;t knitted in some time. But I am working on a scarf for a friend who is walking the 60 miles in three days for Susan G. Komen.  
I am excited about the scarf I am making and am really enjoying it, especially since it is for a dear friend who is doing something amazing for herself and for a great cause. Knitting can really be so relaxing for me. Back to knitting &#8230;
