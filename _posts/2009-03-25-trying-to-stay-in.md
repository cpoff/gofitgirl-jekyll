I am trying to keep healthy and keep up with Go Fit Girl! I am not doing a good job of either. But I am trying.  
Last week I only worked out twice. This week so far three times&#8211;3 yoga classes.  
And this whole work thing gets in the way of my exercise and sometimes of making good food decisions&#8211;esp. with all the free food around here!  
I have given up on eating healthy until next Tuesday. Last week started out great and then I just went down hill with cake and parties at work, then Reno, etc. This coming weekend I am heading to Florida to visit my friend Kate and meet her baby. It is so hard to eat healthy when traveling&#8211;esp. at airports. Options are very limited.  
So even though this is horrible, I am pretty much giving in to most temptations knowing that Tuesday it is back on the wagon for me. I need to lose about 5 pounds to be back at my goal weight. I know I can do it. I lost 30+ before, so 5 is nothing.
