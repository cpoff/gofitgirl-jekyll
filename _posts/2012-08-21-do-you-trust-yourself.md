    Strong arms and strong core (among other things) are important for many yoga poses.

Tonight in yoga the theme was trust.  
There are poses in yoga I don&#8217;t trust myself in. Like [headstand](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/481) and [handstand](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/788).  
Years ago one of my yoga teachers told me she thought I was ready to try one of them. And I just didn&#8217;t feel ready. And years later I still don&#8217;t.  
I don&#8217;t feel like my arms are strong enough. My core could use some work on being stronger. I don&#8217;t trust (there&#8217;s that word) my funky shoulder. And frankly, those poses scare me.  
(And I have been practicing yoga for about five years.)  
Tonight the whole class was a preparation for [crane pose, Bakasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/468).  
I trust myself in in this pose. I am OK falling over or not being able to get both of my legs off the floor. But the part I struggle with is really holding my core strong and up.  
It is easy to forget that the core and its strength is just as if not more important than the strength of the arms.  
Vickie prepared us all class for crane pose. Once we were ready she broke down the pose and had us slowly work into it.  
Breaking down a challenging pose helps make it make more sense and show where every body part should be. In crane pose I am usually a little confused on where to place my arms.  
I trusted myself tonight to work into the pose and try to balance. Once my second foot leaves the floor I don&#8217;t stay up very long. But that&#8217;s where I need to work on it. I really got engage my core and make it work for me in that pose.
