I normally weigh in on Mondays, which I did last Monday and was, I believe, 2.4 pounds from my goal weight&#8211;on track with losing weight.  
I decided to weigh in on Thursday&#8211;right before heading to Missouri to visit the in-laws (eating home cooked food and, of course, Midwestern food). Really, I was curious how much I would gain over this weekend.  
When I weighed in Thursday I was just .2 away from my goal weight. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. I seriously have no idea how I lost almost2 pounds in four days.  
Anyway, so we&#8217;ll see what the scale says when I weigh in on Tuesday.  
Oh, I did get some exercise in yesterday. Marilyn, my mother-in-law, and I went for a walk with Katie, little doggie. It was a nice walk&#8211;about 45 minutes.
