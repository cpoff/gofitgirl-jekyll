My IT/Webmaster consultant (aka The Husband who also answers to Curt) has done some tinkering with Go Fit Girl!  
We are still working out some kinks. (Some of my recent posts went missing. And I think they are good as gone, which I am bummed about. Those things take time to write and research. But enough pouting. If you want to know about how I didn&#8217;t eat candy for 47 days or how I rarely take the stairs at work &#8230; well, maybe I can recreate when I am feeling up to it.)  
Please be patient as we make adjustments and changes.  
Let me know what you think of the new look, whether in comments or via e-mail to ann@gofitgirl.com.  
Thanks to all of my faithful, occasional and new readers. You are all appreciated.
