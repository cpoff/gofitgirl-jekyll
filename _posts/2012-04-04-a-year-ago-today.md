A year ago today my life changed.  
A year ago my company moved from Emeryville to South San Francisco.  
&nbsp;  
That move changed my life in many ways. I am surprised I have lasted a year but then I am not surprised. Is that weird?  
I now get up for work at 5:30 a.m. Something I never thought I would do. This means I have to go to bed between 9:30 and 10 p.m.  
I still drive to the old building in Emeryville and then jump on the shuttle bus, which drives us the 20ish miles to South San Francisco.  
Since I don&#8217;t drive to work I have become a bag lady: big purse; gym bag; lunch bag; laptop bag.  
I have learned how to maximize my working hours and really focus on time management. I now work fewer hours&#8211;as in no longer averaging 10-hour work days. I just can&#8217;t with my long commute.  
One thing that I have really been focusing on and excelling at is maintaining and enhancing my exercise. I work out 6-7 days a week. We have a pretty nice gym at work and I utilize it 2-3 times a week. The [espinner](http://www.spinning.com/spinning-shop-spinner-bikes/spinner-bike-eSpinner.asp) is a great thing for me. If I have time I get some weights and abs in as well with the free weights, weight machines, benches, medicine balls, etc.  
I get yoga classes in anywhere between 2-4 times a week. (I try to switch up a day or two and go back and forth with the yoga and spin.)  
Saturdays I hit my regular gym for two hours of spin; abs and body conditioning.Â (I have a lot of friends in those Saturday classes. They are the main reason I have&#8217;t quit the gym yet.)  
I work from home on Fridays. It&#8217;s a nice way to start my weekend. I get a lot done. And it makes the commute a little more tolerable with it only being four days a week. And I get to sleep in, which means waking up at 6 or 6:30.  
Being driven to work is a nice thing. I can sleep, veg, read, knit, work, listen to music, chat with friends, etc. It&#8217;s my me time. My exercise seem to also be my me time.  
My time in the evenings is rather limited. Depending on if I work out at the work gym or go to a 6 p.m. yoga class I am usually home between 6:45 and 7:30. In that time I have to shower; make dinner; eat dinner; get my gym bag or yoga clothes ready for the next day; get my clothes ready for the next workday; get lunch ready for the next day; blog; and also catch up on a show or two. That&#8217;s a lot to do in roughly two hours. But somehow I do it.  
Here&#8217;s to another year &#8230;
