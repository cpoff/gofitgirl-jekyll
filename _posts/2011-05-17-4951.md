I don&#8217;t really have anything to write about today.  
I did spin on the espinner today for about 45 minutes. The workout was endurance and I could feel it in the back of my thighs and glutes.  
After spinning I tried out the medicine ball and did some squats and ab work.  
What I really wanted to share today was the picture of the cat to the left. Isn&#8217;t it hilarious? I call him or her Go Fit Cat!  
There is a web site called mlkshk, which is an image sharing site, similar to Flickr. And that is where this picture came from.  
Enjoy!
