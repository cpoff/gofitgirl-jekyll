    Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s Day &#8230; with a Guinness.

I have never really been a Guinness fan. While in Dublin years ago I had a couple of the black stuff while at the brewery. And damn, it was good. I haven&#8217;t had any since &#8230; until today.  
After my yoga class Curt and I headed out for brunch. I went all Irish. I had a Guinness and a shepherd&#8217;s pot pie. Wow, that pot pie was amazing (and probably super unhealthy). And the Guinness was nice to drink.  
Curt and I came home from brunch and put in our garden. After our over-exertion we decided to head to our favorite local bar, McNally&#8217;s, for a drink. I decided to go for another Guinness. And I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.  
Is Guinness good for you?  
As I am researching there is no real clear answer to this question. Though leaning toward no seems better than leaning toward yes.  
The calories and alcohol content tend to be lower than other beers.  
According to [Realbeer.com](http://www.realbeer.com/edu/health/calories.php), a 12-ounce Guinness draught has 4% alcohol, 125 calories and 10 grams of carbs. (Just a reminder that a pint is 16 ounces.) I looked up a few other beers for comparison, all for 2 ounces: Blue Moon White: 5.4% alcohol, 171 calories and 12.9 carbs; Budweiser: 5% alcohol; 143 calories and 10.6 grams of carbs; Heineken: 5.4% alcohol, 166 calories and 9.8 grams of carbs; Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: 5.7% alcohol; 171 calories and 14.1 grams; and last, a beer Curt and I used to drink a lot in Portland, Henry Weinhard&#8217;s Private Reserve: 4.5% alcohol, 128  calories and 9.2 grams of carbs.  
According to a [Men&#8217;s Health article](http://www.menshealth.com/jimmy-bartender/guinness-facts), (and many other articles I read) said Guinness has a high-iron content and that pregnant women and nursing mothers are urged to drink a pint. The stout contains “antioxidant compounds” similar to those found in certain fruits and vegetables. These compounds slow down the deposit of cholesterol on artery walls.  
I have heard that Guinness contains iron and women, pregnant women and nursing mothers are encouraged to drink it. But everything I read today doesn&#8217;t really support that. According to [Mail Online](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1222684/Dont-believe-say--Guinness-isnt-good-you.html) (and many other sources), a pint of Guinness contains 0.3mg of iron, less than three percent of daily adult needs.  
So whether you are having a Guinness, another beer or any alcohol, make sure to drink in moderation. And hell, in between drinks have a glass of water.
