    CoCoo is good with the altitude. And so far I am, too.

Who knew I would have things to write about while on vacation?  
As soon as we got to Iris and David&#8217;s on Sunday night David poured all of us a glass of bottled water. He told us to make sure to have lots of water because of the altitude.  
Normally I drink a good amount of water daily. But when I am on vacation or out of my routine I tend to slack on the water intake. So this will be a challenge for me.  
David asked me if I could feel the altitude as I walked upstairs to the guest room. I told him no and asked what that would feel like. Apparently heavy breathing and a faster heart beat are some of the symptoms.  
The altitude in Mexico City is 7,350 feet. The mile high city, Denver, is 5,280 feet.  
According to [Wikipedia, Altitude sickness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness)—also known as acute mountain sickness (AMS), altitude illness, hypobaropathy, or soroche—is a pathological effect of high altitude on humans, caused by acute exposure to low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude. It commonly occurs above 2,400 metres (8,000 feet).\[1\]\[2\] It presents as a collection of nonspecific symptoms, acquired at high altitude or in low air pressure, resembling a case of &#8220;flu, carbon monoxide poisoning, or a hangover&#8221;.[3] It is hard to determine who will be affected by altitude sickness, as there are no specific factors that correlate with a susceptibility to altitude sickness. However, most people can ascend to 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) without difficulty.  
According to the [Travel Doctor](http://www.traveldoctor.co.uk/altitude.htm) the only cure for mountain sickness is either acclimatisation or descent.  
So I think if we take it easy this week and don&#8217;t go crazy we should be OK. And if you have ever traveled with Curt and me you know that we are pretty easy going when it comes to travel. We love our cafe time and to relax and enjoy wherever we are visiting.  
So far I have felt any serious effects from the altitude. Going up stairs makes me winded. But it does at sea level as well. At that has more to do with my asthma than anything else.
