    Adho Muka Savanasana (Downward Facing Dog) is a basic yoga pose and part of my first week of home practice.

In my first Saturday yoga teacher training class we focused on home practice and [I, of course, wrote about it](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/09/learning-home-practice/).  
To be a good and effective yoga teacher I must have a regular home practice. Five times a week for about 45 minutes is what is recommended.  
I couldn&#8217;t commit to that at first so I have started with 20-25 minutes five times a week.  
The first week that I committed to a yoga home practice I practiced five times (Monday through Friday) for 20-25 minutes.  
The second week I tried a different variety of poses to practice and did it five times (Monday through Friday) for 20-25 minutes.  
On the days I work from home I am able to make my practice a little longer. But on the days I have to go into the office I do a shorter practice as I am now getting up on those days at 5 a.m. (30 minutes early) to get my practice in.  
I wanted to share with you the first week of practice I did. As the first week went on I adjusted my practice. I ended up holding each pose for six breaths.  
And depending on how much time I had a savasana was anywhere from 8-20 minutes. Also depending on my time I may have done this practice through a couple of times.  
Here is my very first official yoga home practice:

  * Start standing in [Tadasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/492) (Mountain)
  * [Uttanasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/478) (Forward Fold)
  * [Ardha Uttanasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2490) (Half Forward Bend)
  * [High Lunge](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2488) (right foot forward)
  * [Virabradrasana I](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/1708) (Warrior I)
  * [Virabradrasana II](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/495) (Warrior II)
  * [Utthita Trikonasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/494) (Extended Triangle)
  * [Adho Muka Savanasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/491) (Downward Facing DOg)
  * High Lunge (left foot forward)
  * Virabradrasana I (Warrior I)
  * Virabradrasana II (Warrior II)
  * Utthita Trikonasana (Extended Triangle)
  * Adho Muka Savanasana (Downward Facing Dog)
  * Step forward to Tadasana (Mountain)
  * Uttanasana (Forward Fold)
  * Ardha Uttanasana (Half Forward Bend)
  * [Vrksasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496) (Tree pose, standing on right foot)
  * Vrksasana (standing on left foot)
  * Adho Muka Savanasana
  * [Savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482) (Corpse)

The Yoga Journal website [provides many poses in English and Sanskrit](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/finder/browse_index). This is a great resource, which I have been using a lot lately.  
Starting tomorrow I will try a third home practice I have written out. I had decided to do a focus on twists. Then Thursday night in class we focused on twists. Great timing!  
As I continue with my home practice I make edits and adjustments. I am finding what works and what doesn&#8217;t work. I am making sure to include poses I am not a fan of. I also include at least one balancing pose, which could be the pose I am not a fan of or be in addition to.
