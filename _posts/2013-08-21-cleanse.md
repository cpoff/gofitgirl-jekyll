    I munched on raw veggies while drinking my Creamy Cado green smoothie on Monday.

Green Surge  makes organic, green smoothies. They come into work twice a week and sell smoothies. They also have a 1-day, 3-day and 5-day [Summer Cleanse](http://us6.campaign-archive1.com/?u=94350268b60ca166216b20279&id=3f22ec3ebe&e=%5bUNIQID%5d).  
I did the 3-day with some other co-workers so we could &#8220;suffer&#8221; together.  
The Surge Express Cleanse provides about 1,ooo calories of dense nutrition a day. Every morning six smoothies are delivered and are numbered in the order they should be consumed.  
I decided to do the cleanse for a few reasons. I think a detox occasionally is good for most people. I also really need to get back on track with my nutrition and felt that was a great way to launch back into it.  
The fact that my friends are doing it along with me makes a difference as well.  
I have my six smoothies a day along with raw veggies at lunch, a banana in the morning and I had a few homegrown (small) tomatoes last night and tonight.  
A cleanse is not healthy for everyone. Make sure to check with your doctor if you have any questions or doubts or thyroid disease, digestive disease or are recovering from an eating disorder. Liquid cleansing is not recommended for people with diabetes.  
Cleansing is a great way to jump start healthy habits. Toxins are released during a cleanse while taking in lots of greens, fruits and vegetables.

  According to Green Surge, many people reported most of the following benefits:
</p>

  * More energy
  * Improved digestion
  * Increased mental clarity and focus
  * Clearer skin
  * Steadier energy/mood
  * Decreased inflammation
  * Decreased allergic reaction
  * Decreased cravings for sugar and refined foods
  * More cravings for greens, vegetables
  * Improved sensitivity to flavors
  * Awareness of the effect of eating specific foods
  * Mindfulness around eating
  * Increased desire to create and maintain healthy habits
  * Improved mood because they knew they were doing something good for themselves

Some of my favorite smoothies have been Just Peachy – Spinach, peach, mango, lemon; Blue Moo – Swiss chard, blueberry, banana, almond milk, purple cabbage, lemon; Bok Choy Joy – Bok choy, pineapple, orange, coconut water, banana and lemon. My absolute favorite green smoothie was Charcolate – Swiss chard, banana, almond milk, agave, cacao powder, vanilla extract. It tastes like chocolate milk.  
I am glad I did the cleanse. It wasn&#8217;t super difficult but it also wasn&#8217;t easy. Having support from others helped. And I am glad it is coming to an end.  
There were 18 smoothies total. There were three that were tough to drink and I just couldn&#8217;t finish.  
If you decide to do a cleanse make sure it is reputable. According to Green Surge, _ _in an extreme fast, such as a lemonade-based Master Cleanse that lasts for weeks or more, it’s possible that more stored toxins will be released into your system than you can actually excrete. This can create a host of toxicity symptoms such as acne, moodiness, and hormone dysfunction.
