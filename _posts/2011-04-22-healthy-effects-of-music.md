Don&#8217;t stop believin&#8217; &#8230; music can make you happy.  
I keep hearing this Kaiser Permanente commercial on the radio, which talks about how music makes us happy.  
And it does. A song can come on and totally change my mood. I can be driving to work early on a Monday morning tired and kinda bleh and then all of a sudden a fun and good beat comes on and I am rockin&#8217; out. There are the few songs that I hear that make me sad or really reflect about something in my life. But for the most part, most songs put me in a good mood or keep me in a good mood.  
And since I am on the this mini research kick I thought I would see what I could find online from some experts. (This is what happens when I am stuck at home recuperating from my mini cold.)  
According to WebMD, [if you make music, that can help you reduce stress](http://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/features/how-making-music-reduces-stress). Apparently casual music-making can short-circuit the stress response.  
According to [eMedExpert, music can have positive effects on pain management](http://www.emedexpert.com/tips/music.shtml). The article also states that music is one of the few activities that involves using the whole brain.  
An [About.com article](http://stress.about.com/od/tensiontamers/a/music_therapy.htm) talks about how music has a profound effect on the body and psyche.  
Think about a favorite song and how you feel whenever you hear it. For me, one of my favorite songs is I Will Survive. This is a great song when you are out on the dance floor. I love it. It&#8217;s so much fun. That is just one of many that make me feel good and happy.
