Sometime back I bought Sally Hansen&#8217;s Airbrush Legs. For whatever reason I didn&#8217;t try out the product immediately.  
Lucky for you, my dear readers, I decided to put this leg makeup through some stress tests via GFG!  
This stuff works. It looks natural and it looks good and I look tanned.  
The instructions tell you to spray into your hands and rub into your legs and feet. I spray it right on my legs and rub it in like lotion. The instructions also say to let it set for 60 seconds before dressing. I always wait a little longer.  
Friends and co-workers were impressed at how great it looked.  
I was impressed with the fact that it really didn&#8217;t rub off. Not in my clothes or my sheets. It did rub off a little on the inside of my ankle socks while working out, but nothing that didn&#8217;t wash out.  
The product also claims to be water resistant, which I believe is true. The makeup wouldn&#8217;t come off while in the shower until I rubbed my legs with soap and water.  
I also tried this product while at the pool in Vegas recently. I was armed with a dark colored towel just in case this stuff went running all over the place. As I was sunbathing a little rubbed off onto the towel while lounging for hours. But the same would happen with face make up.

Full disclosure: The product was applied after I showered (and shaved) and applied lotion, sun screen and then the leg makeup.  
After taking a dip in the pool the leg makeup was not running. When I dabbed the water off my legs no makeup came off on the towel. But if I rubbed the water off my legs then some would smudge the towel. Water resistant (as it claims), not water proof.  
I continue to use Airbrush Legs. It&#8217;s a great to make untanned legs look tan. If you want to show up at the pool without a white glow, spray this stuff on. It&#8217;s inexpensive, looks natural and is safe.  
I have no complaints about this product. And give Sally Hansesn&#8217;s Airbrush Legs 4 1/2 dumbbells.
