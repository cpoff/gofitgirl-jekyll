I have been really working on my [Chaturanga Dandasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/469) in yoga. It is a difficult pose. Between my lack of upper body strength and my slight scoliosis and my major arch in my lower back this pose looks weird when I do it.  
We focused on that pose a lot during Monday morning&#8217;s class. During and after class I talked to Sarah, the instructor, about it. Sarah asked me how many times a week I do weights. I told her once. She told me two times a week would really help. Not sure how I am gonna fit that into my workout sked since I already work out 6 days a week for a total of seven hours. Maybe 15 minutes after one of my evening spin classes.  
Sarah told me that I need to work on upper body strength with [lateral pulls](http://www.ehow.com/video_2350754_lateral-pull-exercise-tips.html) and [tricep](http://www.workoutbox.com/exercises/arm-exercises/tricep-extension-dumbbell-lying/) exercises. I do some shoulder weight work in my Saturday body conditioning class. And we do the tricep exercises linked to earlier and [these](http://www.shapefit.com/triceps-exercises-tricep-dumbbell-kickbacks.html) and [check out this video](http://video.about.com/exercise/triceptoning-mov.htm). Most of these I could do at home while watching TV. I think I could even mimic the lateral pull with my pink dumbbells.  
Oh, there is one benefit to having wimpy skinny arms &#8230; no fat. So I have pretty decent muscle definition in my arms. Can&#8217;t say that about the lower body. Much work to do in that area.
