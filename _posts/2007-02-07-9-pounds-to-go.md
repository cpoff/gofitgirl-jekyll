I think these last 9 pounds are gonna be a little harder to lose. But I know I can do it.  
Curt and I are going to Hawaii in about 10 days and I AM gonna have as many drinks with little umbrellas in them as I want. I still will eat whatever I want&#8211;but I won&#8217;t stuff myself. So no points in Hawaii&#8211;just some wise choices when it comes to some of the things I eat.  
I recently started working out, too. I was determined to be toned for Hawaii&#8211;ain&#8217;t gonna happen. But hey, I am 20 pounds lighter than I was 3 1/2 months ago.  
I have been better about my water intake. WW has a [honkin mug with a straw](http://cgi.ebay.com/Weight-Watchers-32-oz-Water-Intake-Mug-w-Straw-liquid_W0QQitemZ330081173243QQcmdZViewItem#ebayphotohosting) and one mug is 4 servings of water. WW recommends 6 servings a day. So I try to have at least 6, but usually go with 8 a day. Problem is I have to go to the bathroom like every 10 minutes it seems! (The link of the mug I found is on eBay. The prices for the mugs on eBay are a total rip-off!)

Off to the bathroom again &#8230; (TMI, huh?)
