Work is getting overwhelming and just, well, tough.  
I still try to make sure I get to the gym 4-6 times a week.  
Spinning out my aggressions on the bike usually makes me feel a lot better. Especially if there is good music.  
Ending my work week with an intense and calming yoga class on Friday evenings is a nice way to end the week.  
I need the gym to keep me sane.
