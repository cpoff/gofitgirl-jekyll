      MiO Liquid Water Enhancer I got at the grocery over the weekend. And I had a $1 off coupon.

  <br /> OK, so it is looking like this week might be a water theme. Maybe.

I forgot to mention in my post last night that when I exercise I drink about 16 oz. of water. That is in addition to the roughly 80 oz. I get in on an average day.  
When I was doing Weight Watchers a lot of women found that drinking water with a straw seemed to help them drink more water. I used to use a Weight Watchers 32 oz. mug with a straw.Â That worked for me for a while and then it didn&#8217;t.  
I am finding [my sippy cup Camelbak water bottle](http://www.rei.com/product/776890/camelbak-better-bottle-16-fl-oz) is working pretty well for me lately. As is my acrylic cup with a straw at work. Room temperature water is best for me when I am just sipping water. If I am having a meal or working out I tend to like my water colder.  
Sometimes water can get boring. So far I am not bored &#8230; yet. But when I was at the grocery the other day I sampled water flavored with [MiO Liquid](http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2011-02-22-watertweaks22_ST_N.htm). And it was pretty good. So I got the Strawberry Watermelon water enhancer. I tried it today at work with some water. And I have to say it is rather tasty. It kinda tastes like Kool-Aid.  
[Crystal Light](http://www.kraftbrands.com/crystallight/Pages/default.aspx#/refreshing-flavors) is also a great water enhancer. My favorite is the lemonade.  
Just a reminder that the majority of your water should be good old fashioned unenhanced water. Some enhancers are OK, just be careful with them.  
Two other things. One: [Please look over my post about wanting to review toner shoes](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=4546). And think about throwing a buck or two my way to help me buy those shoes. And two: to give you a heads up &#8230; tomorrow will be a Comment Contest Tuesday post.
