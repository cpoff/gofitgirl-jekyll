    I love my new Asics.

Years ago I went to a store that specifically sold athletic shoes. The woman who helped me measured my foot and asked me what I mostly needed them for. Was I a walker, runner, what kind of exercise did I do?  
From what I told her she came up with an athletic shoe that was right for me. These are the [Asics she recommended for me](http://www.davesproshop.com/index.html/html/site-product/mfrnum/T954N-9193).  
I also have a pair of [clip shoes I wear, which I purchased at REI](http://www.rei.com/product/810728/pearl-izumi-x-alp-seek-iv-bike-shoes-womens). Mine are blue. I love wearing clip shoes while spinning. Before I had clip shoes my feet would fall asleep and I would get foot cramps almost every class. Now I just get the sleeping foot and foot cramp only once in awhile.  
And I have the barefeet for yoga. No measuring or purchasing required. (Just maybe a pedi now and then.)  
I recently bought a new pair of tennis shoes. I am sorry and sad to say I didn&#8217;t do any research. And they didn&#8217;t have the same style I bought previously. I just went to the store and got a recommendation from the kid selling them. The shoes I got are Asics. I really like that brand and think it is great for my feet. These are the [shoes I purchased](http://www.shoestation.com/Asics-GEL-1160-T0J8N0121-Raspberry-Lightning/PAMPIAELDCEEILIG/Product).  
He also recommended some insoles, which I bought but haven&#8217;t actually used yet. Yea, I know.  
My shoes are fairly stable and seem to be a good fit for my needs. The stability of my Asics is on the inside of my foot. My last shoes had the same stability. From what [I read about pronation here](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-240-319-327-7727-0,00.html), I appear to be an underpronator.  
This is a [great guide to buying Asics](http://www.asicsamerica.com/shoefitguide/45r). I highly recommend this shoe.  
This [article explains the five biggest mistakes](http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/choosing-best-workout-shoes?ecd=wnl_dia_090611) when buying exercise shoes. It explains how and what you should do and not do when buying shoes for exercise. It is important for your feet and you.
