My Christmas Hatha Blend! class will be from 10-11:30 a.m.<a href="http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/buffalo-soldier/" rel="attachment wp-att-15283"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15283" src="http://gofitgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/buffalo-soldier-286x300.jpg" alt="buffalo-soldier" width="286" height="300" /></a>  
Suggested donation: $10-$20. All proceeds will be donated to [Standing Rock](http://standingrock.org).  
Spots are filling up, but there are still some openings available. Space is limited. Sign up ahead of time to secure your spot.  
You can sign up by calling 503-922-3100 or [going online](https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/home?studioid=14726).  
We will have fun with our holiday-themed sequence as we will stretch, strengthen, open and relax the body and mind. We will end in a long and lovely savasana.

## &#8216;Buffalo Soldier&#8217;

Portland, Ore. artist, Ryan McAbery, has created &#8220;Buffalo Soldier&#8221; Standing Rock Bison Fundraiser (pictured at the right).
