While Curt and I were in Turks & Caicos we noticed some feral but friendly dogs and cats hanging around the resort.  
The dogs are called Potcakes.  
According to the [Potcake Place website](http://www.potcakeplace.com/info/what-is-a-potcake),Â Potcake is the name given to the dogs of the Bahamas and the Turks & Caicos Islands. It came about because the locals fed the caked remains of the cooking pot to the dogs.  
Potcakes ended up evolving into a breed. According to the site, they are extremely smart, loyal and loving.  
There is no animal shelter on Turks & Caicos. The Potcake Place volunteers rescue the dogs and keep them in their homes until a permanent home is found.  
According to a pamphlet I picked up there are many ways we can help: adopt; courier a puppy from the island to their new home; volunteer, [donate](http://www.potcakeplace.com/donate) food or pet supplies; foster; educate; spay and neuter; and sponsor a puppy in care.  
These are all awesome ways to help Potcakes. Some are simple and some involve more dedication.  
My favorite way to help a Potcake (besides adopting) is to volunteer to be a courier. Potcake Place takes care of all the arrangements. All the courier volunteer does is carry the puppy in its carrier onto the plane, keep under the seat, hand over documents to customs officials and turn the dog over to its new owners at the airport destination.  
My [sweet, precious Joey](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=7487) was a Dumpster kitty. He and his litter were found in the garbage. I rescued him and gave him a good life. And he gave me a good life of companionship and unconditional love.  
Some day Curt and I will adopt a dog. We are partial to labs, lab mixes and greyhounds. I wouldn&#8217;t mind also adding a Potcake to the possibilities.
