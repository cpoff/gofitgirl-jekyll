    One of my favorite poses is Child's pose. It is a resting pose, but can also really work the hips.

I write a lot about my yoga practice.  
Sometimes my practice is about exercise.  
Sometimes it is about connecting deeper with myself.  
Sometimes it is about breathing.  
Sometimes it is about endurance.  
Sometimes it is about remaining calm.  
Sometimes it is about getting stronger, physically.  
Sometimes it is about taking care of me.  
Sometimes it is a combo of these or all of them.  
Yesterday in Aviva&#8217;s class she talked about focusing on the head, neck and shoulders.  
She read us an excerpt, which she will send to me later. Part of it read like this:  
Yoga is &#8230; wisdom of the mind, will of the heart and skill of the body.  
I really like that. And I have really been reflecting on it since she read it yesterday.
