    My lunch today was a yummy and filling salad.

After three days of no exercise and pretty much stuffing my face with Mexican food and other delicious and delightfully unhealthy stuff I was back at it with my regular routine today.  
I hit the gym for 45 minutes of endurance spinning and 15-20 minutes of some arm weights and abs.  
For lunch today I had a salad. I tried to make it healthy and filling with a little grilled chicken, spinach, carrots, a little cheese, beets, a little corn, quinoa, strawberries, onions, mushrooms, etc. For dressing I had oil and vinegar.  
I wouldn&#8217;t say I exactly detoxed today. I had one cup of coffee and then water for the rest of the day. Though that is usually the norm.  
For dinner tonight I had steamed broccoli and brown rice with some seasonings. It was filling and pretty tasty. It&#8217;s one of my regular and favorite dinners when eating healthy.  
The two Hershey&#8217;s kisses were much better than what I could have been stuffing my face with. Plus, there were leftover breakfast burritos from some morning meeting and I didn&#8217;t have any of that. Especially since I had already had my Bagel Thin with Light Laughing Cow cheese and a nectarine.

The next couple of weeks will pose a challenge to my healthy living. Thursday and Friday of this week I have training in the city. That means I will be eating out for breakfast and lunch. Breakfast is easy as I can have a soy latte and oatmeal at Starbucks. That also means it will be more difficult to exercise. I already have a few social things planned which have to do with eating and/or drinking this week as well.  
Next weekend I am traveling to LA for a conference. So there will be lots of eating out and free meals, activities, etc. I am hoping to hit the gym at the hotel every day. I come back from LA and it is almost my birthday weekend &#8230;  
All I can do is my best.
