Comment Contest Tuesday is back, at least for today.  
Keeping with the water theme &#8230; tell me how you get your daily water in. Do you have tricks, ways to make it easier, enhancers? Or do you just down your daily water with ease and grace?  
If you haven&#8217;t quite mastered getting a healthy amount of water in every day, how much are you drinking? Why are you struggling?  
To participate in Comment Contest Tuesday answer the above question(s) in the comments below. You can comment as much as you like. The comment has to be relevant to the actual question(s). For every time you individually (one comment per reply) comment your name will be thrown into a hat three times. Up to three comments will be counted. So you could have your name in the drawing a total of nine times. Just make sure each comment is in its own reply. Does that make sense? I just don’t want people writing the three comments all in the same reply–I can’t always tell if I should count those once or more than once. Winner and prize will be announced sometime next week. So you have a whole week to come up with some comments.  
You have until next Tuesday at noon (my time) to comment away. You have to comment in the comments on Go Fit Girl! I won’t accept e-mails, comments on Facebook, etc.
