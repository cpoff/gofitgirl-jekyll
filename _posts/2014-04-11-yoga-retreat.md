    Here I am in the yoga studio in Viparita Virabhadrasana (Reverse Warrior Pose). My backdrop during my yoga practice while in Mexico will be the beautiful sand and water.

Tomorrow my mom and I head to Mexico for a week-long yoga retreat called [Spring Liberation Retreat](http://melinameza.com/1887-2/) at a retreat center called [Prana del Mar](http://pranadelmar.com).  
I have been looking forward to this for quite a long time. I seriously need a vacation. I am looking forward to a full week of yoga and meditation practice. I am excited to share this experience with my mom and spend time with her. I am also looking forward to deepening my yoga and meditation practice.  
From the pictures everything looks absolutely gorgeous and amazing.  
I am not sure what the wifi situation is. I am sure there will be some way for me to post. I hope I can at least update a couple of times and tell you all the amazing things we are doing, learning and the delicious gourmet meals we are eating.  
According to [Melina&#8217;s](http://melinameza.com/1887-2/) (one of the teachers) [website](http://melinameza.com/1887-2/): Come join us for this uplifting spring yoga adventure at Prana del Mar in Baja, Mexico. Prana del Mar is a deluxe retreat center nestled in the outskirts of Cabo San Lucas, where the Pacific Ocean, Sierra de la Laguna mountains, desert landscape, and blue sky come together to liberate you from any winter challenges you experienced and open you to the flowering possibilities that  spring offers.  
According to [Baxter&#8217;s](http://www.baxterbell.com/schedule/retreats/) (another teacher of the retreat and one of my regular yoga teachers and a teacher in my yoga teacher training) [website](http://www.baxterbell.com/schedule/retreats/): A typical day on retreat: Morning mediation; asana practice; breakfast; workshops in [Ayurveda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda), [Yoga for Healthy Aging](http://yogaforhealthyaging.blogspot.com) topics; lunch; free time; late afternoon asana practice; sunset meditation; dinner; and occasional evening program.  
I&#8217;m hoping after this week I come back Zen-like, relaxed and a new person. And I am hoping that glow lasts for more than a day after I get back to work.
