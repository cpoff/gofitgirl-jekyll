    Day 1: Bananas are about the same amount of green. The top banana goes into the green bag. The bottom doesn&#8217;t. Day 4: The bottom banana has a few spots. Day 7: The two bananas are noticeably different. Day 14: The bottom banana is almost entirely black while the top banana is in OK shape.

At some point at the grocery store I had noticed green bags for sale, which claimed they could keep produce fresher longer.  
My grandpa and I even discussed these. He mentioned he had tried them and they worked. But he didn&#8217;t know why.  
So I decided to experiment with them myself using Brawny&#8217;s Produce Protector Reusable Bags.  
I used two fresh slightly green bananas that looked pretty much the same. One went into the green produce bag the other sat in the fruit bowl. (Top left photo)  
After four days (top right photo) I compared the bananas. The bottom banana had a few spots.  
After a week I compared the two bananas (bottom left photo). The bottom banana, the one that stayed in the fruit bowl, had many more spots than the top. The top hardly had any spots.  
After two weeks (bottom right photo) the bananas were both gross but were very different looking. The bottom banana was almost completely black. The top one looks OK. But I didn&#8217;t want to eat either one of them.  
These Brawny Produce Protector Reusable Bags worked. I think a week is the max they should be utilized &#8230; for bananas anyway. I haven&#8217;t tried other fruit yet.  
I definitely want to try some other items in the bags, especially salad. (I read a review raving about how well the bags work with lettuce.)  
There are a variety of green reusable bags on the market, such as: Debbie Meyer GreenBags; Peak Fresh Re-Usable Produce Bags; Reusable Green Fresh Bags. I haven&#8217;t used these others I listed. But I am going to guess they basically work the same as the Brawny bags.  
The back of the packaging for the bags says the bags remove ethylene gas to prolong the life and freshness of the produce. Most fruit and vegetables release ethylene gas after harvest. Exposure to the gas accelerates aging in fruit and vegetables.  
I don&#8217;t remember how much I paid for the package of 10 bags. But online they are about 10 bucks.  
If you buy a lot of fruit and veggies and feel like you are composting too many of them because they go bad before you have a chance to use them I suggest you invest in reusable produce bags. They will save you money.
