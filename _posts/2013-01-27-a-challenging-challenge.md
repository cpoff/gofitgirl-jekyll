    Supported Child&#8217;s Pose, which is my favorite restorative pose, is so relaxing and helps calm me. When this pose isn&#8217;t possible, like while at work, I concentrate on my breathing. Even breath in and out.

One of the challenges for [January&#8217;s Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10083) is to work on curbing unproductive complaining, to be [more aware of what we are really complaining about](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10134). It is just bitching or is there some truth and necessity to it?  
I will admit I am having a hard time with this challenge.  
I have been super negative at work&#8211;some of it is just the regular crap. But some big changes are happening, which I have been trying to process and emotionally deal with.  
I don&#8217;t do well with change or uncertainty.  
I do believe everything happens for a reason. And usually the reason is not evident immediately.  
I don&#8217;t like being so negative. It is such a waste of energy. I want to focus my energy on things that are important, things that need my attention and energy.  
Earlier this week I took a break from Facebook, Go Fit Girl! blogging and research, Twitter, etc. I went to work and yoga and then spent my evening just vegging. I did that for two nights and it was a great relief. On Thursday evening I got a massage. Massages may seem like pampering. But I do believe they help with mental and physical health and is a necessity. I try to get one once a month.  
My efforts to breathe and relax help with stress and negativity. I have also been making it a priority to make it to the Sunday night Restorative yoga class. Tonight&#8217;s attendance in class means I went every Sunday in January.  
(My regular Restorative teacher was supposed to teach tonight&#8211;her last class before she went on maternity leave. But the 3-month sub was teaching tonight. So congrats to Megan on her baby girl!)
