  Hey friends! Welcome to my first newsletter.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  I&#8217;m so excited to start a newsletter. I&#8217;m not sure yet how often a newsletter will come out. But I won&#8217;t go overboard. I know we all get lots of junk and can miss the important e-mails.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  My newsletter will update you on things going on for me and you. Whether it&#8217;s about yoga, indoor cycling, a blog post, eating/cooking, a workshop or something cool coming up. You will be updated here and you can always go to my blog for information as well: <a id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1461019023558_36607" href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/GoFitGirl/ann-s-first-newsletter/4976249-gofitgirl.com/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Go Fit Girl!</a>

  Last week&#8217;s yoga sequence theme was about us going bone deep. Weight-bearing yoga poses can reverse the negative effects of osteopenia (loss of bone density) and osteoporosis (bone loss). I wrote a <a href="http://gofitgirl.com/2016/04/bone-deep/">blog post</a> about it, which also has a link to the <a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/GoFitGirl/ann-s-first-newsletter/4976257-well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/12-minutes-of-yoga-for-stronger-bones/?c=e2fd99c3-6e22-4470-ac1f-1b685e4f7000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New York Times article: 12 minutes of yoga for bone health</a>, which I referred to during my yoga classes.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Every week I have a theme in my yoga classes. My week of teaching runs Wednesdays through Mondays. The current theme is about your brain on yoga, running through Monday, April 18. Practicing yoga can help make you feel happier, less depressed and sad while also calming those monkey minds/brains.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The following week&#8217;s theme is in celebration of Earth Day, which is Friday, April 22. From Wednesday, April 20 through Monday, April 25 we will focus on yoga poses where we are connected to the Earth, feeling grounded, rooted and balanced while also challenging ourselves. We&#8217;ll work with yoga poses that reinforce inner stability, strength and balance.
