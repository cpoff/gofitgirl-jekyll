I am excited to announce that next month I will be teaching Yoga in the Park.  
I will be teaching two yoga class(es) for all levels.  
If adults want to bring their kids along that is welcome. But children must be accompanied by an adult.  
Details below:  
**THE WHAT:** Yoga in the Park with Ann  
**THE WHERE:** Evelyn M. Schiffler Memorial Park, SW Erickson Ave., Beaverton, OR  
**THE TIME:** 6-7 p.m.  
**THE DAY(S):** Tuesday, August 9 and Tuesday, August, 23  
**THE PRICE:** Suggested donation of $5 (but no one will be turned away)  
**WHAT ELSE:** Bring your yoga mat. Be dressed for a yoga class. Clothing should be comfortable.  
Feel free to bring a picnic to enjoy after class and hang out.
