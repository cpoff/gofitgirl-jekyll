    Lots of coconut water to choose from.

At some point recently I saw coconut water at [Trader Joe&#8217;s](http://www.traderjoes.com/) and decided to buy some. I knew it was all the rage, but I wasn&#8217;t sure why.  
The other day at the yoga studio they had juice box like container of coconut water for free. I took one.  
Yesterday I had a raging headache at work. I figured it was because I was dehydrated, stressed and I am sure my heavy (but delicious) lunch didn&#8217;t help. I decided to skip a workout and come home to lounge. When I got home I thought I would have a little bit of coconut milk.  
I finally decided to read the information on the container.  
Coconut water has so many benefits. It naturally rehydrates the body with electrolytes.  
According to [Livestrong.com](http://www.livestrong.com/article/521215-the-benefits-of-electrolytes-in-water/), Electrolytes come in different forms, including chlorine, potassium, phosphate, magnesium, calcium and sodium. You must keep electrolytes balanced within your body to allow it to maintain proper water amounts in your body, balance blood acidity, allow for proper muscle action, and to allow other important processes to occur.

People can lose electrolytes from exercising or while drinking alcohol or caffeine. When we have a cold or the flu we can really benefit from drinking the coconut water, too.  
According to another [Livestrong.com article](http://www.livestrong.com/article/557222-five-healthy-alternatives-to-water/), coconut water hydrates the body while providing other beneficial nutrients, such as vitamins, antioxidants and amino acids.  
According to the packaging on the [O.N.E. coconut water](http://www.onedrinks.com/) carton, it is an excellent source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure and heart function. It will naturally rehydrate the body with electrolytes. It has 15 times more potassium than sports drinks and more potassium than one banana.  
I am not a huge fan of coconut. But this stuff isn&#8217;t bad. And you don&#8217;t need to drink a lot to get some great benefits of the water.  
The other great thing is that you can add it to other things as well, like the smoothie I made yesterday.
