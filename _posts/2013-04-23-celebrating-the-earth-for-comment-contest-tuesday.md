Yesterday was Earth Day. What did you do to celebrate?  
My company is hosting Earth Week this week.  
Yesterday we had a Farmer&#8217;s Market; today is eWaste disposal for a free lunch; tomorrow&#8211;Wellness Walk; Thursday&#8211;a sustainability quiz (not quite sure what that means); and a Vendor Fair on Friday, which I will miss since I will be working from home.  
I am sure like most of you, I celebrate Earth Day every single day.  
We recycle,we compost, we recycle batteries and light bulbs.  
I use reusable bags to grocery shop and hit Trader Joe&#8217;s and Target. I carry a [chico bag](http://astore.amazon.com/gofigi-20/detail/B001PL6E7Q) in my purse so I always have a bag when I need one. I recently started using [washable reusable produce bags](http://www.washableproducebags.com). (Read Go Fit Girl!&#8217;s [Review Wednesday](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10349)Â on this product.)  
We don&#8217;t run our dishwasher (I&#8217;m the dishwasher).  
We both use some form of public transportation to get to work (subway and shuttle service)&#8211;we both have long commutes. We only have one car.  
What did you do to celebrate Earth Day? Or what do you do regularly to celebrate our beautiful Earth.
