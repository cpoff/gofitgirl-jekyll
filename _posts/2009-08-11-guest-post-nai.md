When I was 28 years old, I was diagnosed with diabetes, a little young in my opinion! Initially, I was depressed and upset, but I soon realized that being in that emotional state wouldn&#8217;t do me any good. D<span id="lw_1249595110_0" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">iabetes</span> is rampant on my mom&#8217;s side of the family so I knew I had to do something.  
At the time of my diagnosis, my doctor didn&#8217;t feel that I needed any medication. Instead, I was told to eat <span id="lw_1249595110_1" style="BACKGROUND: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none">healthy foods</span> and exercise regularly.  
I was determined to change my health so I signed up for a <span id="lw_1249595110_2">gym membership</span> and worked out religiously, which was about four times a week for 1-2 hours each time. I kept that routine up for about three years. Eventually, I went from a size 10 to a size 6-7 and my sugar was well under control. I was so proud of myself.  
That was then, this is now. I haven&#8217;t been working out consistently, which has been about two years now and frankly, I&#8217;ve become quite depressed about my health. Recently, I had to go to the ER because my diabetes was so out of control. The doctor had threatened to put me on insulin if I didn&#8217;t change that.  
Now that was enough to get my toosh back to the gym! So for the first time in a long time, I went back to the gym last week. I worked out for an hour and a half. At first, I thought I would be totally burnt out, but I wasn&#8217;t. In fact, I felt great!  
Anyway, enough about me. All I can say is that I&#8217;m determined to keep my diabetes under control by eating healthy (even if it&#8217;s not what I want to eat, such as salads) and working out consistently. I will go to the gym at least three times a week and walk for at least 30 minutes during my lunch hour. Hey, I may not go back to my old routine, but I&#8217;m determined to be a healthier person. Most importantly, to get my diabetes under control.  
Stay tuned &#8230;
