Since Wednesday I have been on track with the exercise (the food is another story, but it usually is).  
I had planned to hit Vinyasa Yoga class (and take my mom) on Sunday. But we had flight issues and instead of coming in Saturday night about 8 p.m. we came in on Sunday at almost midnight.  
I wanted to go to the noon spin class on Monday. But I felt pretty wacked out and I didn&#8217;t want to drive anywhere. So I just hung around the house doing laundry, going through the mail and paying bills and watching TV.  
Wednesday was Hatha Yoga with Baxter. Man, I really love that class. Baxter is great. Thursday I did the spin bike in the work gym. I only had time for a 30-minute workout as I had something to do after work. But 30 minutes is better than nothing. Friday was Forrest Yoga with a sub. I normally like the regular teacher. But I think I liked it even better with the sub. That was an intense class. I could feel my thighs and shoulders today. And, of course, today, spin; abs/core; and body conditioning. I almost ditched the third class. But I decided to stick with it.
