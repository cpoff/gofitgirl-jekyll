Or maybe not.  
Erica and I recently were discussing over e-mail about whether or not your thighs get bigger because of spin.  
I have noticed recently that some of my pants seem tight in the thighs (pretty much all of my pants are tight in the butt area&#8211;that has always been an issue for me since I have a big butt and hips). And I am still on track with my weight maintenance.  
I did some research online. I found some sites that said your thighs and butt do get bigger with spin. And others that said that wasn&#8217;t the case.  
So I went to my best source, my spin teacher, Jennifer. She says your thighs **don&#8217;t** get bigger because of spin. Yes, they can get more muscular and toned, but not bigger. She didn&#8217;t have an answer to why some of my pants are tighter in the thigh area.  
So, hmmm. Wonder why our pants are tighter?
