My friend and reader Karen asked me a question couple of months ago. And I am finally answering it.  
Karen wanted to know how I keep my rice fresh after making a week&#8217;s worth in my rice cooker. I bought a [cheap rice cooker at Target](http://www.target.com/Aroma-6-Cup-Rice-Cooker-Steam/dp/B002VHKQCM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&searchView=grid5&keywords=rice%20cooker&fromGsearch=true&sr=1-1&qid=1302230579&rh=&searchRank=target104545&id=Aroma%206-Cup%20Rice%20Cooker%20Steam&node=1038576%7C1287991011&searchSize=30&searchPage=1&searchNodeID=1038576%7C1287991011&searchBinNameList=subjectbin%2Cprice%2Ctarget_com_primary_color-bin%2Ctarget_com_size-bin%2Ctarget_com_brand-bin&frombrowse=0) and I have definitely used it worth every penny and more. (It also steams veggies.)  
At the beginning of the week I make about 4 cups of brown rice. It goes into a Tupperware-like container in the fridge. When I steam veggies or make veggie/shrimp stir fry I get out some cold rice. I add a little bit of water and pop into the microwave for a minute.  
I add my veggies or stir fry to my nuked rice, which seems almost fresh to my taste buds.  
I can&#8217;t guarantee how fresh the rice actually is. But it tastes fresh and good and works for me. It takes a long time to make rice. Plus it is also difficult to make a small portion of rice every day.
