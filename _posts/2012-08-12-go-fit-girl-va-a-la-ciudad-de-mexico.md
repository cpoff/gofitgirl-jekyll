    The &#8220;last time&#8221; I was in Mexico City was almost 36 years ago. My mom said I was almost 2. And last time Doggie (pictured above) went with me. Doggie is staying home this time. He&#8217;s too old and missing an ear. Doggie is posed with our pesos.

According to Google Translate the headline above says: Go Fit Girl! goes to Mexico City.  
Almost two months ago I made the decision to rejoin Weight Watchers.  
I needed accountability with my food intake. And I am proud to say with my food tracking and really paying attention to what I put in my mouth I am on track to hit my goal weight (again) soon.  
There are times I let myself go &#8220;off plan,&#8221; like when my mom was in town. I didn&#8217;t go too crazy. But I did enjoy my food and drink. Now I didn&#8217;t lose weight that week, but I also didn&#8217;t gain either.  
When I go on vacation I like to eat and drink whatever I want. So in Mexico City I will be doing just that. And then a week later when I get home, I will get back on plan and lose my last few pounds.  
I likely won&#8217;t be posting much while on vacation. If you want to know what I am up to over the week check out my [personal Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/chihak). We are staying with friends and will have wi-fi so I will be status updating or uploading photos occasionally.
