I am reviewing our menu for Thanksgiving and it seems that the only healthy item on the menu is green beans and probably the chicken breast or turkey breast being made and brought by our friends Jim and Jennifer.  
There will be ham, biscuits and stuffing, well, I am going to attempt to make my dad&#8217;s stuffing recipe. Keep your fingers crossed for success.  
Jim and Jennifer are bringing the poultry, mashed potatoes, pumpkin cheesecake and an appetizer. Our friend David is bringing wine, because according to him we don&#8217;t want to eat anything he cooks.  
I decided to make this post a special Comment Contest Tuesday on a Wednesday. You can comment from today until tomorrow (Thanksgiving) at noon (my time).Â Tell me what you are making or eating or not eating. Is anything healthy?  
Comment as much as you like. Each individual comment posted will have your name thrown in the drawing twice. So comment away. Same rules as always, comments only in the comments will count. No comments on Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, etc. will count.
