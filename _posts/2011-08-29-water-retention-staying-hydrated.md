    We always have low sodium soy sauce on hand for sushi delivery.

When I eat sushi (or really the soy sauce) I retain water like crazy. (Curt and I had sushi for dinner last night.) I can eat some foods with pretty high sodium levels and not feel the effects. But for some reason soy sauce gets me every time. Even if I use the low sodium soy sauce, which I try to use every time I have soy sauce.  
The first time I figured this out was probably about four years ago. I had sushi one night and then the next day weighed in at my Weight Watchers meeting. I was getting pretty close to my goal weight. So I was excited to see the number on the scale. I stepped on the scale and saw that I had &#8220;gained&#8221; 2 pounds. I was so upset and couldn&#8217;t figure out why the number was going up. My leader asked me what I ate for dinner. We figured it out pretty quickly.  
There are so many things that can alter the numbers on the scale. The two big ones for me areÂ [water retention](http://www.water-retention.net/causes-of-water-retention/) or dehydration. One weekend I was so hungover that I lost 6-8 pounds. The moment I started feeling better and eating and drinking fluids again that weight was back.  
Drinking water and staying hydrated is so important for your health for so many reasons. Once you feel thirty it&#8217;s too late. You are already dehydrated. So keep drinking that water. Find ways to drink as much water as you can every day. Basically you should drink half your weight. If you weight 150 pounds you should try to drink 75 ounces a day, which comes out to about nine 8 oz. servings.
