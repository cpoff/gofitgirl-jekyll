    Weekend coffee and some delicious Peanut Butter Energy Balls.
  </p>
</div>

  
I made a second batch of Peanut Butter Energy Balls on Friday. I used the ground flaxseed, which the recipe called for, instead of [sesame seeds I used last week](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=8755).  
And I have to say, this second batch is much tastier than the first. I also added a little more peanut butter.Â I actually made two batches this time around: one with chocolate chips and one with raisins.  
I think I like the raisin ones better, crazy, I know. But the raisins are smoother than the hard chocolate chips.Â Curt and I snacked on them over the Â weekend. I think I snacked a little more than he did. ðŸ™‚  
I found the ground flaxseed at Trader Joe&#8217;s in the cereal aisle with the various oatmeals.  
I took some into work today for my co-workers.  
I handed out a a bunch of Peanut Butter Energy Balls to co-workers today. Of everyone I got feedback from, the energy balls got a thumbs up. (And they could possibly be a cure for Spring Forward exhaustion. OK, maybe not. But they could help, just a little.)  
Here&#8217;s the recipe again, in case you want to try it yourself:  
1 cup regular oatmeal  
1/2 cup peanut butter (I added about 3/4 cup.)  
1/3 cup pure, unfiltered honey  
1 cup coconut flakes  
1/2 cup ground flaxseed  
1/2 cup chocolate chips (or craisins or raisins or another sweetness of your choice)  
1 or 2 tsp of vanilla extract  
Using your hands, mix all the ingredients well in a bowl. Let it chill for at least 1/2 hour in the fridge. After the mixture is chilled, use a teaspoon to size out scoops of the mixture and roll into balls. Will keep in Tupperware in the fridge for seven days. Enjoy!
