Today in Vinyasa Yoga class with Ashley we did our regular heated flows. After about 45 minutes to an hour of the flows and sweat we usually concentrate on something, whether it is working a specific part of the body or working on an inversion.  
Today we worked on some intense hip openers with variations of [Pigeon](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/863) and [Square](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2477).  
We did one hip opener/restorative pose before [savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482).  
My hips aren&#8217;t as open as I would like. So I especially appreciate when class concentrates on opening of the hips. I can&#8217;t say I love Pigeon Pose. But for some reason I always want to do that pose and am happy when the instructor asks us to get into that pose.  
One of my least favorite poses is [Happy Baby](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/490), which is also a hip opener and another pose we did today. We also did that pose on Wednesday night. Baxter made a joke about whether or not we are happy in the pose. I have to say, I never am. I have no issues getting into the pose. But once it is time to get out I feel stuck. It&#8217;s a pretty intense pose for me.
