Ugh!!! Lately the exercise has been minimal and the calories have been at the max.  
I was at the gym today walking to my spin class. I saw one of the body conditioning instructors working out. We said hi and then he said, Looking good. I laughed, mostly because the pounds are piling on. But it was still a nice compliment.  
As of today I am trying to be better when it comes to caloric intake, time at the gym and a better work/life balance. Work is absolutely insane&#8211;but I am making my best efforts to make it to the gym regularly.  
Wish me luck &#8230;
