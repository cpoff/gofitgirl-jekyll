    Loved Twice set up at Peet&#8217;s for donations: money and baby clothes.

Peet&#8217;s near my gym has gotten me into helping a couple of &#8220;new&#8221; charities.  
A few years ago there was a representative from a women&#8217;s day drop-in center, which I still support to this day. In fact, I just took some toiletry donations over there about a week ago.  
Today after spin I grabbed a soy latte and noticed a set up for a charity called Loved Twice, which is geared toward helping babies.  
According to the [Loved Twice website](http://lovedtwice.org/about-us/),Â the organization helps underprivileged newborns in the San Francisco Bay Area community, giving disadvantaged babies a better start in life.  
At the coffee shop you could donate clothes or money. I threw in a little money.  
I plan to knit some baby hats for the organization. Not sure if I will have them done in time for Christmas. But that doesn&#8217;t matter. I can donate anytime.  
There are so many charities and people out there who need our help. And I know I can&#8217;t help everyone. I try to focus on children, food banks, women (centers to help women, whether day center or shelter and Planned Parenthood), a little with animals &#8230;  
Curt and I also like to support our alma maters. We both help with scholarships. When I was in school I benefited from journalism alumni-donated scholarships and promised myself one day when I could afford it I would do the same.  
Don&#8217;t forget: This coming Tuesday is another Comment Contest Tuesday, which is focused on charities and the [December Heart Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9919).
