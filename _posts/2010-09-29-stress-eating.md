Today was a stressful day on a few levels.  
As I stated yesterday I am not hitting the gym this week in the hopes I take it easy I feel better quicker. But that also means I have to be much more careful in the caloric intake department.  
Things were going well until this afternoon. Even my visit to Starbucks was decent with a [light Caramel Frappuccino](http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/frappuccino-blended-beverages/caramel-frappuccino-light-blended-coffee). But after that I just needed to much. And at one point I even attacked my candy bowl.  
OK, well, that stuff happens and I am not gonna beat myself up over it. The first slip-up since I started counting points again. I think I am in Week 4 of tracking food.
