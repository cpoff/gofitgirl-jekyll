So the healthy eating has continued into Week 2. And I have been trying to limit the alcohol intake to just weekends. So far so good on that goal. The last adult beverage I had was a glass of wine on Saturday.  
I haven&#8217;t felt that I have encountered any major food obstacles in the past week and a half. I have eaten out and have been able to accommodate for that each time. A little planning helps.  
I am continuing to track my food by counting calories with eating and exercise.  
I wasn&#8217;t able to hit the gym yesterday. But it is Thursday and I have taken three spin classes this week.
