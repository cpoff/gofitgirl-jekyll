    Mexican food. Oh yum! I am sure I will be eating a lot of stuff like that over the weekend.

As I do most Fridays I worked from home today. I also attended the 10 a.m. yoga class. I either take that class on Fridays or the now 5:30 p.m. class.  
It was important for me to keep my exercise as regular as possible since I am going to Tucson this weekend. We are celebrating my grandpa&#8217;s 90th birthday. So there will be a lot of eating and drinking over the weekend. I mean, what better way to celebrate than with Mexican food and alcohol?  
There will be lots of eating, drinking and running around town getting errands done for Grandpa&#8217;s party as well as getting family visits in over the short weekend.  
I am hoping I can do some yoga with Hilda, my dad&#8217;s wife, once or twice over the weekend. She is a yoga instructor.  
As long as we aren&#8217;t too busy I hope I can squeeze in some yoga with her. Or I guess I could do it myself. But that isn&#8217;t as fun.
