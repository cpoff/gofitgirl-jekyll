    After my graduation, one year ago, I posed with Baxter, my mentor, and my certificate proving that it was official!

A year ago today I graduated from my yoga teacher training at Piedmont Yoga Studio in Oakland, Calif. Wow, it&#8217;s already been a year? Wow, it&#8217;s only been a year?  
Marilyn, my mother-in-law, asked if there would be video of my graduation. I told her no, but there would be photos. Curt did end up taking video. You can [watch it here](https://www.facebook.com/fatback/videos/vob.500998656/10152199151703657/?type=2&theater).  
I had some idea of what I would use my new knowledge and skills toward. But I had no idea I would be where I am today.  
It&#8217;s better than I ever imagined.  
Two days after I graduated I headed to Tucson for some R&R and some time with my family.  
I taught my very first yoga class at [Mindful Yoga Studio](http://www.mindfulyogatucson.com) as a donation class on that trip. It was a scary, but great experience. I appreciated that Hilda let me teach the class at her beautiful studio and all of the students and friends (and family) who came to support me (and Tucson&#8217;s food bank).  
I started subbing at Alameda Athletic Club in August and September for the regular teacher. She went on maternity leave in October and I took over her classes while she was on leave.  
Since I had been taking indoor cycling classes for years I decided to get certified to teach these classes as well. I took the certification class and exam in December.  
Once Curt and I were settled in Portland I started contacting gyms and studios near where we live at the end of January.  
But the end of February I was teaching a few classes a week.  
I am now teaching five cycle classes and eight yoga classes each week with a few sub classes sprinkled in. Also in the temporary I am working a front-desk shift at [Turtles Yoga & Wellness](http://www.turtlesyoga.com) to learn a few things and help out.  
My updated [class schedule can be found here](http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/), where my yoga classes and cycle classes are listed along with any classes I am subbing.  
I really do love teaching and I think I found my true calling. I love connecting with my students and having fun.  
The relationships I have already developed in such a short time is so gratifying. I want my students to trust me and come to me when they need.  
I want to share what I know and learn about yoga, the body, the mind, the breath, alignment, etc. with my students in both yoga and cycle.  
I want to help them find a deeper place in themselves and with their relationships.
