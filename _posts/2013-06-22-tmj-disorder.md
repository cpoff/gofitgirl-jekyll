When I was in junior high and high school I had braces. Four long years &#8230;  
While wearing braces I developed [TMJ (Temporomandibular Joint) Disorder](http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/features/tmj-treatment-options).  
Occasionally in the past 20 or so years it flares up. I can yawn and my jaw will pop. Or trying to tackle too big of a burger can cause discomfort.  
There are [jaw exercises](http://www.wikihow.com/Cure-TMJ-with-Jaw-Exercises) I can do to ease the pain and discomfort.  
My TMJ can also flare up when I am stressed or emotional.  
It flared up again on Monday. It&#8217;s been an emotional and sad time lately.  
My jaw pain gets a little less painful each day. But it is still lingering.  
Wow, who knew there was a [TMJ support group online](http://www.mdjunction.com/forums/tmj-discussions/introductions-personal-stories/19331-tmj-triggers)? Many admit that stress can cause the TMJ symptoms to be triggered.  
The [resistance training jaw exercise](http://www.wikihow.com/Cure-TMJ-with-Jaw-Exercises) eases a lot of my pain and discomfort. That&#8217;s the one I normally work on with my jaw. I am also occasionally taking Aleve.  
I wondered if my TMJ is a cause of the jaw/tooth pressure I get sometimes when I am flying.  
[Dear Doctor](http://www.deardoctor.com/inside-the-magazine/issue-11/pressure-changes-tooth-sinus-pain/) doesn&#8217;t mention a connection between the two.  
But I found another article that briefly mentions it. [Community Health Training](http://communityhealthtraining.org/TMJ.htm) says one of the symptoms of TMJ Disorder isÂ ear fullness and pain during airplane takeoffs and landings.  
The article also mentions how TMJ Disorders are caused. I fall into a few of them:

  * Habitual gum chewing and nail biting. I chew gum very regularly. I used to bite my nails when I was younger.
  * Dental problems and misalignment of the teeth (malocclusion). A few reasons I needed braces were because my mouth was too small (ha ha!) and my teeth were off centered, which made my teeth misalign when I bit down.
  * Stress (Who doesn&#8217;t experience that?)

There are other symptoms listed as well. Click on the Clinical Health Training link above to read more. The article gives an explanation of what TMJ Disorder is; what TMJ Disorders are and how they are caused; common symptoms; and ways to treat.
