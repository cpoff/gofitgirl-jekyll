One of my team co-workers recently started exercising. She is taking it slowly with walking on the treadmill. I am proud of her for making the commitment and making it to the gym.  
Her back was really bothering her yesterday. She wanted to at least do some stretching. I told her that about a month ago my back was also bothering me. So I just went online and found some yoga stretches andÂ [then, of course, wrote about it](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=5869). I printed out the stretch diagram pictured to the left for her.  
I went down to the gym before her and did about 45 minutes of cardio. She came down right when I was finishing up. Perfect timing. So we did the series together. I also had her do a [standing forward bend](http://www.yogamums.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/forward-bend-200x300.jpg) against the wall. She couldn&#8217;t reach her hands to the ground. We don&#8217;t have any [yoga blocks](http://www.yogaaccessories.com/thumbnail.asp?file=assets/images/ProductImages/YogaBlock4_Amazon.jpg&maxx=275&maxy=0) at the gym so [I propped up two dumbbells for her to place her hands on as if we had blocks available](http://satiama.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Standing-Forward-Bend-Pose2.jpg). That gave her a better and safer stretch.  
She said [child&#8217;s pose](http://maxcdn.fooyoh.com/files/attach/images/612/958/783/004/yoga-childs-pose.jpg) felt really good for her back. I told her that one is great for relaxing and for her back. She told me she did the stretches again last night. And her back felt a little bit better today.  
All of these stretches would actually be a great way to end a tough day. Or even great to do before going to bed.
