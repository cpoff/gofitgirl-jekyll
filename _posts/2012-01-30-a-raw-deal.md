Last night I struggled to eat my dinner green smoothie. But I ate it.  
This morning I cracked open my breakfast green smoothie. And it just tasted gross. I took about 10 bites and I just couldn&#8217;t do it. So I ditched it and had an apple and banana for breakfast. My goal was to keep it raw.  
About 11:30 I cracked open my lunch smoothie. Ugh! I couldn&#8217;t do it. I decided that that was it. I was done.  
I went downstairs to get a salad and soup for lunch.  
I thought about trying my dinner smoothie tonight. But the idea of eating green goopey lawnmower pulp makes me ill.  
I did my two transition days. And I did three full days of three smoothies for three meals. I am proud I got that far. I am still disappointed that I couldn&#8217;t complete the full seven days.  
I think the most impressive part about my cleanse is that I went to our upstairs neighbors&#8217; party for three hours and didn&#8217;t eat or drink anything except water. It was tough, but I was determined.  
Oh yea, I haven&#8217;t mentioned that I am sick &#8230; again! Just three weeks after I got over my 2-week cold. And BAM! Now I have some chest thing. At first I thought the slightly scratchy throat and congestion over the weekend was just the toxins leaving my body. But today I was convinced that I have a cold. Booo!  
As soon as this post is uploaded and on to Twitter and Facebook I am taking a shot of NyQuil and hitting the sack.
