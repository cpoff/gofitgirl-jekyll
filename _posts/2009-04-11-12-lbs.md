For the past week I have been tracking my food. I have been doing pretty well if I do say so myself. Avoiding many temptations.  
Saturdays are the days I weigh myself, at the gym. According to that crappy scale I gained 12 pounds in a week, which I know isn&#8217;t true or else none of my clothes will fit.  
Someone else got on the scale and said it was off.  
I was so mad. I wanted to know if my hard work paid off this past week.  
Bummer!
