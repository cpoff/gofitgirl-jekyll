After my yoga class today I hit Peet&#8217;s to get a coffee and while there decided to also get a pumpkin bread.  
I knew the pumpkin bread would have more fat and calories than I really wanted to consume. But what the hell, right?  
I got to work and checked the [nutritional information](http://www.peets.com/shop/essentials_detail.asp?id=1369&cid=) online. My small soy latte was reasonable with 90 calories and 3 grams of fat. The yummy pumpkin bread, not so much at a whopping 380 calories and 16 grams of fat!  
That pumpkin bread was HALF of the Weight Watchers daily points that I am allotted right now (while trying to lose a few pounds). Luckily I have some flex points sitting around waiting to be used.  
Lesson learned: When you got to Peet&#8217;s for coffee, just get the coffee. No yummy, tempting goodies!
