A co-worker brought in Krispy Kreme doughnuts to work today. Evil woman!!!  
I decided to look up the nutritional information on the Web site. Hmmmm, not easy to find. I used Google to look it up and somehow came upon the [KK nutrional information page](http://www.krispykreme.com/nutri.html), which I could NOT find from the main page.  
Once I finally found the page I clicked on U.S. and a tiny box opened up on my screen. I couldn&#8217;t make the box bigger. I did, however make the text 150% and could read it better but had to scroll over to get all info. An original glazed is 200 calories with 12 grams of fat.
