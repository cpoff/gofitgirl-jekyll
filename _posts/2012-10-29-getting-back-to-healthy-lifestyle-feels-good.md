    Getting back to my regular exercise classes feels good. Jessica kicked our butts tonight in body conditioning with some abs, cardio and weights.

Last Monday I put myself back on plan.  
Back to my healthy lifestyle of regular exercise, eating better and tracking food/exercise.  
And I have to say I feel so much better maintaining a healthy lifestyle than that month that I just went nuts. I felt tired and just crappy.  
I still feel tired and crappy, but in a different way. Does that make any sense?  
Last week was probably one of the toughest weeks to start back on the healthy plan AND try to lose weight.  
Even though I have had many challenges this past week: two lunches out; dinner out; drinks one night, which turned into a light dinner; home cooked meal by an amazing friend; cruddy and busy week at work I still managed to get my regular exercise in and keep my calories in check.  
AND the best part was I lost weight. I am back on track to get to my goal weight again.  
As I have said before: If you have the tools and knowledge and you want to lose weight you will. If you don&#8217;t want to lose weight you won&#8217;t. I know it doesn&#8217;t seem that simple at times but really it is.  
And if you want a supportive buddy, I am right here. We can IM, text, talk on the phone and if you live in the Bay Area we can talk in person or meet for a gym class or yoga class.  
I really didn&#8217;t want to go to class tonight. But I knew Monica was going. And more important relying on me to get to class a little early and set up our spots with steps, weights, body bars and mats.  
That is a great motivator to get me to the gym and that class. And I get to work out with a buddy.
