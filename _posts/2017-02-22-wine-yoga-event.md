<a href="http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/hcdw-yoga-poster-png/" rel="attachment wp-att-15644"><img class="alignleft wp-image-15644" src="http://gofitgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/HCDW-yoga-poster-PNG-212x300.png" width="300" height="424" /></a>I am super excited to announce that I am partnering with Hip Chicks Do Wine for two wine and yoga events.  
Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll practice yoga first and enjoy wine after. Yoga before wine &#8230; you&#8217;ll be fine.  
There are two wine and yoga events planned for Saturdays, April 8 and May 6, from 1:45-4 p.m.  
Cost is $15 in advance/$18 at the door.  
Registration is from 1:45-2 p.m.; yoga from 2-3 p.m.; and from 3-4 p.m. we&#8217;ll taste four wines from [Hip Chicks Do Wine](http://hipchicksdowine.com).  
All levels of yoga are supported and welcome.  
Please wear comfortable clothing and bring a yoga mat.  
I anticipate these events selling out, so it would be a good idea to buy your tickets ahead of time.  
You can purchase your tickets on [Hip Chick&#8217;s website](http://hipchicksdowine.com).
