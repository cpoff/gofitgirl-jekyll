This week has been a tough one at work. A particular project plus everything else I have to do is keeping me rather busy and slightly frazzled.  
At some point in the early afternoon I knew there was no way I was going to make my 5:30 spin class. I just accepted it and moved on and continued working until about 7.  
At least I took a lunch break and visited [Emeryville&#8217;s Farmers&#8217; Market](http://emeryvillefarmersmarket.weebly.com/), which is still pretty new. I went a couple of weeks ago and bought some amazing organic blueberries. Curt and I both really enjoyed them. So I went back for more. For lunch I had veggie spring rolls, which were pretty good and surprisingly filling. To drink I had French lemonade, which was sparkling, with lavendar ice cubes. So yummy!  
I came home tonight tired and decided to have a beer. Sigh.
