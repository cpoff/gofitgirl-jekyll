    Apparently teaching yoga at Turtles Yoga & Wellness is where I should really be. I had forgotten about my mini turtle obsession until I needed a photo for this post.

About two weeks after moving to Portland I subbed my first yoga class at the fitness center in our town home community (free yoga classes where we live!) and a couple of days after that at a gym near me called The Xtreme Edge.  
Six weeks after moving to Portland I started teaching at LA Fitness for both yoga and indoor cycling.  
I teach six regular classes a week at LA Fitness and one at 24 Hour Fitness with sub classes (mostly yoga) sprinkled in just about every week.  
On Saturday I am teaching a special class at [Turtles Yoga & Wellness](http://www.turtlesyoga.com), which opens at the end of this month. My class on Saturday is from 11 a.m.-noon.  
At the end of this month I will start teaching two regular yoga classes at Turtles and have one shift a week at the front desk &#8230; to learn the business.  
I will be teaching Wednesday mornings from 10-11:15 a.m. and Thursday evenings from 7-8:15 p.m.  
My [bio](http://www.turtlesyoga.com/about-turtles-yoga-and-wellness/meet-our-instructors/) (scroll down a bit) has been posted. And the full Turtles [class schedule](http://www.turtlesyoga.com/class-descriptions/schedule/) should be posted very soon.  
To view a schedule of all my classes, go to GFG&#8217;s [my classes tab](http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/).  
I am really excited to start teaching in this beautiful space with the other awesome instructors and amazing staff.
