    I have been using Neutrogena sunscreen products for years. The stick sunscreen is the latest addition to my sunscreen use.

I have written before about sunscreen and growing up under that hot Arizona sun [a time](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/04/armed-with-sunscreen-and-hat/) [or two](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/08/protecting-skin-from-sun-environment-from-chemicals/) [or three](http://gofitgirl.com/2011/06/go-fit-girl-hits-the-mediterranean/) before.  
I pretty much never wore sunscreen and made it my mission to have the best tan of the summer as a kid. I even slathered myself with Baby Oil in order to &#8220;cook&#8221; quicker.  
About 10 years ago I realized my skin had changed and sunscreen was a must.  
I have tried a variety of sunscreens over the years. And my favorite is Neutrogena brand.  
Before my March weekend in Vegas I was at Target stocking up on sunscreen. I got a new bottle of the [Body Mist Sunscreen spray](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+sheer-+body+mist+sunscreen+broad+spectrum+spf+30.do?sortby=ourPicks#), which I have used for the past couple of years and love. I usually use the [Age-Shield Face](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/age+shield-+face+lotion+sunscreen+broad+spectrum+spf+70.do?sortby=ourPicks) or [Ultra-Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+sheer-+dry-touch+sunscreen+broad+spectrum+spf+70.do?sortby=ourPicks) for my face. I noticed a couple of new items for the face: [Face & Body Stick Sunscreen](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+sheer-+face+-+body+stick+sunscreen+broad+spectrum+spf+70.do?sortby=ourPicks) and [Liquid Daily Sunscreen](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/ultra+sheer-+liquid+daily+sunscreen+broad+spectrum+spf+70.do?sortby=ourPicks).  
I decided to try the Face & Body Stick. It&#8217;s like a stick of deodorant. And it is super easy to apply to the face. It&#8217;s for both the face and body. I like the spray for my body and something else for my face. I like to use a higher SPF for my face than for my body.  
The Neutrogena website has this to say about the stick: It gives you the powerful, yet lightweight sun protection you love in a convenient, no-mess form. Suitable for both face and body, this unique wide-faced stick glides on easily and invisibly. Formulated with clinically-proven [Helioplex® Technology](http://www.neutrogena.com/category/sun/helioplex-+technology.do), it offers superior broad-spectrum protection from skin-aging UVA rays and skin-burning UVB rays, so you can have clean, shine-free protection on hand, while on-the-go.  
The stick was easy to use and kept my face protected while I was out in the sun over three days. It is also easy to have on the go. And it&#8217;s not a liquid, so it is travel safe via plane.  
It&#8217;s a little bit greasy. But that is my biggest complaint. I like to wear a pretty high SPF on my face. This one comes in 70 SPF. But no other options that I could find.  
One friend I was hanging out with at the pool while in Vegas mentioned that her Arizona dermatologist along with her mom&#8217;s Arizona dermatologist recommend Neutrogena sunscreen. I think those are two pretty good endorsements.  
I plan to use it along with the Body Mist while in Mexico next week.

    For years I have been using Neutrogena sunscreen products. The latest purchase did not disappoint. The Neutrogena Face & Body Stick sunscreen gets 4 dumbbells.
