Wow, sorry that I haven&#8217;t updated in more than a month.  
Did a lot of traveling in November&#8211;Missouri to see Curt&#8217;s family and then New Orleans with a girlfriend on a kinda last-minute trip. Then it was Thanksgiving &#8230;  
I have been pretty good with keeping up with my working out even during hectic times. Of course, not as much as I would like&#8211;but still pretty regular at the gym.  
At the beginning of December I went back on the WW plan and lost 2.4 pounds in a week. It works if you stay on plan. The following weekend of my wonderful weight loss I had three parties, work holiday party, Monica&#8217;s cocktail party and then Curt and I hosted Cheesemas 2008&#8211;where you eat cheese and watch cheesy holiday movies starring Rob Lowe. ðŸ™‚ So I pretty much threw WW plan out the window. Now I am just trying to maintain. I will be back on a much more rigorous plan in the new year. But I am doing OK maintaining right now. And that is about all I can ask for.  
Yesterday I had my regular Saturday with two hours at the gym: spin; abs/core; and body conditioning. During body conditioning I tweaked my back&#8211;not really sure how. I didn&#8217;t go to the gym today because my back was still hurting and I don&#8217;t want to make it worse. It is getting better tonight and I think I will be back to normal tomorrow. That is the plan anyway because I want to go to yoga tomorrow morning before work.
