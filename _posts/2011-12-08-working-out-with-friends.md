    We used medicine balls tonight while squatting and lunging.

Tonight I hit my regular gym, In-Shape City, and worked out with Jenn, Monica, Pam and Pam&#8217;s daughter, Isabelle.  
We did about an hour of body conditioning with arms, some step ups on the step board, squats, lunges, glutes and abs.  
We did these crazy butt exercises, which we have done in class before. They are always so painful while doing them and then I never &#8220;feel it the next day.&#8221;  
One is called the [dirty dog](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-joFCAMF54K8/TfspIcYXO7I/AAAAAAAACi4/J0u5ZExPWB4/s1600/12.jpg) and the other is [hip extension](http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/leg-exercises-21.jpg). I feel like my butt is gonna fall off (I wish it would) and I want to cry.  
I realize as I list the various exercises we did many were focused on the butt. That is where I need the most work. After that is thighs and hips. And then abs.  
It was a good workout and it was fun hanging out with the girls. I hope this becomes a regular occurrence.  
I have been trying to get more abs and weights into my workouts. My main focus is cardio and then yoga.
