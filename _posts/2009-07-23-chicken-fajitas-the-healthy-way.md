I have one up (well, more than that) on [Chevys](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3029) with my [Safeway Eating Right Chicken Fajitas Stir Fry](http://www.safeway.com/IFL/Grocery/CategoryDisplay?catalogIdentifier=EREatingRight&identifier=ERMultiServeEntrees).  
The stir fry is in the frozen section at Safeway. I also like the shrimp and veggie stir fry. We eat that with brown rice. Very filling and yummy.  
So tonight I made the fajita stir fry for dinner. It cooks up very quickly, is yummy and filling. Curt and I eat the stir fry with corn tortillas. About a cup (prepared) of the stir fry is [130 calories with 3 grams of fat](http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/nutrition-calories/food/safeway-select/chicken-fajitas/).
