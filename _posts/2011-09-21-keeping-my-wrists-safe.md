About [two weeks ago my left wrist hurt](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=6385). I was careful with it while exercising. After a few days the pain went away.  
Yesterday my right wrist started to hurt. I can&#8217;t figure out what I did to either one to have any pain. I do have some pretty skinny wrists. Maybe it&#8217;s all the bags I carry to work. Maybe because I am careless and run into things or over do it. Not really sure.  
Tonight in yoga I was careful in certain poses with not putting unnecessary pressure on my wrist to cause any pain. Downward Facing Dog didn&#8217;t bother me. But plank did. So I usedÂ [yoga dumbbells](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/photo/v0/321136380/yoga_dumbbell_fitness_dumbbell_yoga_equipment.jpg) for plank, luckily we didn&#8217;t do plank much. I also kept my right hand in a fist in a few poses, which made my wrist stronger, more stable and not feel the pressure of some of the poses.  
Yesterday at the gym I did a few exercises with the free weight dumbbells to strengthen my wrists such as [this](http://www.fitness.com/exercises/uploaded/1186947762_0703090453.gif) and [this](http://www.fit4eva.com/dumbell-forearm-ext.gif).  
My wrist feels better today than yesterday. Let&#8217;s hope there is more improvement tomorrow.
