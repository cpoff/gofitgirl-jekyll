Since Saturday I have been to the gym five times.  
When you are traveling a lot, get sick, go on vacation and then come back from vacation and try to catch up and then go to a seminar it is difficult to keep up with the workouts and healthy eating.  
But Saturday was the day I decided to get back on a healthier path. I have done pretty well. I splurged a little yesterday with a work lunch celebrating a friend/co-worker&#8217;s birthday.  
But other than that I have been pretty on track this week.  
Stay tuned for continuing updates.
