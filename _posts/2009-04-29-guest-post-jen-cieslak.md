Tuesday marked a big celebration for my company &#8212; we received some slightly good economic news in this bleak financial climate. And what better way to celebrate than with an artery-clogging, tummy-bulge-building, greasy, grimy, tempting and oh-so-delicious pile of food (Krispy Kreme and Domino&#8217;s, to be exact)?  
These temptations seem to be all around, not just lately and not just at work.  
It&#8217;s Day Two of my &#8220;getting back on track,&#8221; after months of on-again-off-again dieting and so-called life-changing meal plans. I fell off the wagon some time in November, when an injury prevented me from stepping foot in the gym.  
A family emergency kept me from working out again at the beginning of this year. And personnel problems at my gym have had me jumping from one personal trainer to another &#8212; five different trainers in four months. All that time, I was eating whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted it. Not good news for the waist-line or the scale.  
But now I&#8217;d truly like to get back on track.  
I know I&#8217;ve been wasting my time at the gym (sometimes as many as 6-8 hours a week) by allowing myself to overeat and eat the wrong things. I&#8217;m sick of spending so much time exercising and seeing negative results.  
So I&#8217;m giving it the old college try.  
Yesterday I walked right past the doughnuts and pizza to buy a Diet Dr. Pepper. I packed my lunch and snacks and pre-made my dinners for the week. I worked out with my newest trainer on Monday and made it to the 5:30 a.m. bikram yoga this morning.  
The newest trainer&#8217;s mantra seems to be &#8220;it&#8217;s hard work.&#8221; Now it&#8217;s time to get the work done. Lucky for me, it&#8217;s also time for my afternoon snack! ðŸ˜‰
