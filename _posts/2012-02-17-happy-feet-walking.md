    I did a total of 40-45 minutes of walking today. This evening I took a 90-minute yoga class.

I decided to take today off and have a four-day weekend.  
I accomplished a lot today.  
I had a dentist appointment this morning. Then the car had scheduled maintenance. And I started the daunting task of de-cluttering the spare room/office/dumping room.  
I took the car in a little after 9. The dealership offers courtesy shuttle service. It was a sunny and cool morning. I decided to walk home. The roughly 1-mile took about 20 minutes to walk and was quite pleasant. I listened to the morning DJs on my [Radio.com app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radio.com-on-iphone/id323701765?mt=8).  
Once home I had some coffee and breakfast. And then the de-cluttering began.  
About 12:15 or so Curt asked me if I wanted to go have lunch. (Curt worked from home today.) After lunch I walked back to the dealership, which was a pleasant and warmer 20-minute walk.  
I got in about 2 miles of walking today with a 90-minute Vinyasa yoga class this evening.
