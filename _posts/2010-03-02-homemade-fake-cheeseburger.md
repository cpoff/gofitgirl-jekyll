Tonight I made a fake cheeseburger for dinner.  
I made one last week, too. It wasn&#8217;t exactly a substitute for the real deal, but it was satisfying.  
The Boca burger heated up in the oven along with half a potato cut into fries. Once the burger was &#8220;ready&#8221; I put on a piece of fat free Kraft single cheese slice to melt.  
I lightly toasted two pieces of Sara Lee Delightful bread. Once the &#8220;bun&#8221; and &#8220;cheeseburger&#8221; were ready I added a little Light Miracle Whip, a little ketchup and Tapatio. I had the burger along with my potato fries, which were seasoned with Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy and pepper.  
A low calorie and fairly satisfying meal. I also had a glass of red wine to wash it all down.
