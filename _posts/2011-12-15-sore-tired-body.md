    This minty refreshing gel works cold and hot on sore areas. It was a little spendy but so worth it.

This will be a short post as I am tired and well, just bleh.  
Tuesday night Jenn and I did some weight work on our back and shoulders (among other stuff).  
Yesterday I worked from home so I attended the Power Vinyasa yoga class at the studio in my neighborhood. Naushon really had us focus on doing [upward dog](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/474) properly, by pushing our chest forward and our shoulders down.  
Between the work on shoulders/back Tuesday night and the yoga class yesterday and the crappy sleep I have gotten the past FOUR nights I woke up today with super sore shoulders and upper back.  
I know being sore like this is a good thing as I am working my muscles and getting stronger. But it still is not that comfortable.  
(Tonight at the gym I did intervals for spin and a little ab work. I did some stretching of my back and shoulders as well.)  
After I got home I took a nice hot shower. Then I slathered my refreshing gel on my shoulders and upper back. I am feeling a little better. I am relaxing while blogging, watching TV, drinking wine and having a dinner of leftovers.  
(This is all definitely deserved after I hit Marshall&#8217;s and Ross tonight looking for ugly Christmas sweaters for my friend Stephanie and me for our work White Elephant party on Monday. There were like a million people at Ross, the place was trashed, rude people every where and the line was about a mile long. I eventually left after finding a few shirts but really, no Christmas sweaters. Boooo!)
