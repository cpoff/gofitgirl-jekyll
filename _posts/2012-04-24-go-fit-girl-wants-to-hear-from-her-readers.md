I have asked my readers what they think of the new look of the blog. And I haven&#8217;t gotten a lot of responses.  
I know bribery works. So let&#8217;s have a Comment Contest Tuesday to get the comments flowing.  
Tell me what you like about the new look, maybe things you don&#8217;t like. Was there anything about the old look you preferred? What do you think about being able to sign in to Go Fit Girl! with your Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts? Does the site seem to be running faster than before?  
This is a great time to ask me any content questions as well. Feel free.  
OK, here are all the rules for this week’s Comment Contest Tuesday. You can comment as much as you want.  
Each comment in its own post will get your name thrown into the random drawing twice.  
To participate in Comment Contest Tuesday you must submit your answers in the comments below. The comment has to be relevant to what I ask or mention above.  
Comments via e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, etc. don’t count. You have until Friday, April 27, noon my time to comment away.
