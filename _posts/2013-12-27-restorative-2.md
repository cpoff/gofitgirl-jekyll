The [December Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/12/dec-challenge/) was nicknamed 5 for 5.  
A challenge I made for myself was to attend the Sunday night Restorative Yoga class at my yoga studio every Sunday in December (as long as I was in town). (I won&#8217;t be attending this coming Sunday as I will be out of town.)  
The first four Sundays in December I attended the class. And actually I attended the last Sunday in November and the Sunday before that I attended a 2-hour Restorative workshop.  
This past week I have been off work with little planned. I have incorporated more and longer Restorative poses in my home practice. At the end of every home practice I have a [Savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482).  
Vickie reminds her students as we are getting into a Restorative pose that we should be warm, comfortable and even (body should be symmetrical). And it should be dark and quiet.  
There are times when I don&#8217;t feel like doing an active home practice. Those days I do an all Restorative practice with just a couple of poses. I am now well-equipped with props, such as bolsters and blankets, which really support me in particular poses.  
I feel like having a regular Restorative practice keeps me calm and balanced and keeps my weight in check. Studies have been done on the many wonderful things that happen to us when we have a regular Restorative practice.  
Restorative yoga, with its emphasis on supported poses, allows the body to enter the deep, restful state it craves, which is attributed to this [Yoga Journal article](http://www.yogajournal.com/health/2527). &#8220;When you stop agitating it, the body starts to repair itself,&#8221; says Judith Hanson Lasater, who is a Restorative Yoga teacher among other types of yoga andÂ has been a consultant on three NIH studies on various aspects of yoga .
