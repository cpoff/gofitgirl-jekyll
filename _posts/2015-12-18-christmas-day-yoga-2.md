    I am teaching a special Christmas Day yoga at <a href="http://www.turtlesyoga.com">Turtles Yoga & Wellness</a> from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sign up for <a href="http://www.turtlesyoga.com/class-descriptions/yoga-pilates-schedule/">class here</a>. I am honored to offer a yoga practice for you Christmas Day. Maybe you have a quiet day planned for the holiday, whether you celebrate or not. Or maybe your day will be quite busy with many gatherings and visits. Whatever your day looks like, take a little for yourself for a mindful Christmas Day Hatha-alignment based yoga class with me. We will end the class with some yummy Restorative Yoga poses to help you feel supported and at ease. Bring yourself and a friend or family member or both. Come to class to get centered and grounded while connecting with yourself and others.
