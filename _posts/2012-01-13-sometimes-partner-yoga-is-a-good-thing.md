    Lily had us partner up and get into Child's much more deeply. It was like heaven.

I attended my kinda sorta regular Vinyasa flow class tonight. Since getting sick and with the holidays I haven&#8217;t been to that class in probably almost a month.  
The class is slightly aggressive, which is the type of yoga I normally prefer. For me it is all about burning the calories. Though I do take some less intense classes to balance out my practice.  
This Friday night class is supposed to have live music, which I was excited about. Unfortunately Gary got caught in traffic and didn&#8217;t make it to play the [Hang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQXn5ba0aT8), which I have been lucky to hear him play in other classes.  
Today Lily had us partner up. I have to say I am not a fan of partnering up with another classmate. I don&#8217;t really know anyone and usually we are sweating. And well, I just don&#8217;t like it.  
The first partner practice was to help your partner into [handstand](http://www.wholeliving.com/sites/files/wholeliving.com/ecl/images/content/pub/body_and_soul/2010Q2/mbd105582_0410_handstand2a_xl.jpg). She gave us an alternative choice if we weren&#8217;t inverting for whatever reason: [Dolphin](http://www.yogajournal.com/media/originals/2713-98.jpg). I was uncomfortable working on this pose with a partner for a variety or reasons. I didn&#8217;t want to be responsible for anyone falling over or hurting themselves. And I am not ready for handstand, even with help.  
The closest I have gotten to a handstand was doing [Downward Dog against the wall](http://blogs.yogajournal.com/challengepose_mt/half.JPG) with my legs almost straight up. That was intense and scary and exhilarating.  
Later on she had us partner up again. I groaned silently. She had each partner get into [Child&#8217;s pose](http://maxcdn.fooyoh.com/files/attach/images/612/958/783/004/yoga-childs-pose.jpg) with the other partner putting pressure on the sacrum and really getting their partner into a much deeper pose. Then we worked our hands up the partner&#8217;s back and ended with a little massage of the shoulders. Oh yea, that partner practice I liked and appreciated.
