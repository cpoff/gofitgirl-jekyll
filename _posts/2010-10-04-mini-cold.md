So last week I wasn&#8217;t sure if I had allergies or a cold. I think it was a cold, a mini cold is what I like to call it. It wasn&#8217;t a full blown cold. And luckily I am feeling almost back to normal.  
I skipped noon spin class today as I still had a little bit of a cough and I didn&#8217;t think cardio was the best. I plan to attend the afternoon yoga class tomorrow.
