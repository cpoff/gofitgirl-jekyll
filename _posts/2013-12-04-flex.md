Previously I [wrote a review](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/07/review-wednesday-fitbit-zip/) for the [Fitbit Zip](http://www.fitbit.com/zip). I loved it so much that I asked for a [Fitbit Flex](http://www.fitbit.com/flex) for my birthday.  
I love my Fitbit Flex. I wear it around my wrist like a watch or bracelet.  
It does a lot of what the Zip does with a few added features.  
It counts your steps (miles), which can calculate calories. The Flex syncs to an app and a website. On the app and website you can track calories in and calories out, you can track your weight and activity (which will adjust calories out).  
My favorite feature is that the Flex tracks your sleep. You can see when you are asleep, awake and restless. It also has a silent, vibrating alarm.  
When you hit your daily goal of 10,000 steps the bracelet lights up and vibrates in celebration. It&#8217;s fun.  
It took me time to get used to the fact that on the Flex I can&#8217;t see what my steps, miles and calories are, unless I go to the app or website. But if you tap the bracelet it lights up and shows you the percentage you are up to to getting to your 10,000 steps.  
My main complaint about the Zip and Flex is that they don&#8217;t do a great job of tracking when spinning (riding a bike) or while practicing yoga, which are my two main sources of exercise.  
The Zip does a better job of tracking while spinning. (But the steps are still way lower than what I actually ride.) The Flex does a better job of tracking overall steps, including a better job of tracking my steps in a yoga class.  
The Flex comes with two-sized &#8220;bracelets.&#8221; The battery needs to be recharged about once a week. But you can do it right on your computer and within 2-3 hours.  
The Flex is $99.95 and can be worn in the shower as it is water proof. (The Zip is $59.95.)  
This would be a great stocking stuffer for an active person in your life. Hell, it might be great for someone who isn&#8217;t active and this could encourage some more steppin&#8217;.

    I love my Fitbit Flex and give it 4 1/2 dumbbells. It would make a great holiday gift or stocking stuffer.
