    A great, crunchy and munchy alternative to tortilla chips is crispy veggies.

I love to eat. I love to snack. I love to munch on things.  
Eating, lack of exercise, sedentary job, change in metabolism and hitting that 25th year of my life are the reasons why I gained 30 pounds many years ago.  
I lost 30 pounds about four years ago. And probably for two years after that I maintained my weight. I struggle slightly to keep my weight close to my goal weight. The highest I have been away from my goal weight was almost 9 pounds. Lately it has been 3-5 pounds. So not too bad.  
We had friends over on Saturday to watch the Champion&#8217;s League final. Usually when we host a football (soccer) gathering Curt asks me to make salsa. It is easy to make and fairly healthy. But once I start scooping up that salsa with salty tortilla chips it&#8217;s all over. I still wanted to enjoy salsa without going too crazy. So I decided to buy some crisp veggies I could cut into circular pieces, similar to a chip. I cut up carrots, cucumber and zucchini.  
The cut veggies were perfect to scoop up salsa. And I got that satisfying crunch without the huge amount of calories.
