    Me and my long hair. I recently had a trim and had 5 inches taken off. It is still so long. I was planning on getting it healthy and then donating it. But I haven't decided yet what I want to do.

I had an entirely different post planned today. While I was huffing and puffing and riding on the espinner I came up with tonight&#8217;s post, which would have lead into a couple of posts this week. Tomorrow&#8217;s was going to be a Comment Contest Tuesday post &#8230; and then I remembered that today is Tuesday. I am thrown off by the 3-day weekend.  
Slight tangent &#8230; I got on the work shuttle today to go back toward home. I kinda generally announced, well, at least tomorrow is Wednesday. I couldn&#8217;t believe the overwhelming response of joy.  
OK, back to my post, which was the second idea I had. I am gonna talk about my hair. Yea, it kinda sorta fits into the health and fitness category.  
I have a lot of hair. It gets in the way when I exercise. When I spin I pull it back in a ponytail and then braid it. If I leave it loose, that hair is bouncing all over the place. Annoying and distracting.  
As I was lazy (and tired) this morning I just pulled my hair back in a bun type thing on my head. I got a lot of compliments on my hair today. Wow, just pulling it back and not washing it for a few days &#8230; I need to do that more often.  
I don&#8217;t wash my hair every day. I wash it about three times a week. I find that my hair is healthier and I don&#8217;t have to blow dry it so often. I have a lot of hair. But it is fine hair. So I use a dry shampoo between washings to make it look and smell good and and absorb some of the oils. I use [TIGI Rockaholic Dirty Secret Shampoo](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&sugexp=gsis,i18n%3Dtrue&cp=11&gs_id=16&xhr=t&q=rockaholic+dry+shampoo&qe=cm9ja2Fob2xpYyA&qesig=Ju2WT7aeL56Yqw5562KRJg&pkc=AFgZ2tlR3O-9kjczXqku-u5J0Lap7fqYq5kTEIrnPf1qj0DAeLNbYVEEiizXrlx1k1p53JpGyJwHeoLURD_T3G8Vu79UmbRTRQ&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&biw=1268&bih=626&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=18404306398735640571&sa=X&ei=Ot5mTsy-MqXkiAKu-sSpCg&sqi=2&ved=0CGkQ8wIwAQ#ps-sellers). I know there are other options out there, but I haven&#8217;t tried them.  
Another little tangent &#8230; most of my life I had super straight hair. In the past few years my hair has started going curly. Enough that my dad even commented asking me if I had gotten a perm.  
I know a lot of people like to wash their hair every day. I used to because my hair gets greasy so quickly. About two years ago over winter break I decided to try every other day. It didn&#8217;t look great. But my scalp and hair eventually got used to it. Then I started using the dry shampoo and started washing even less.  
Some people want to wash their hair after they exercise because of the sweat. I also used to feel that way. But I exercise almost every day and most of the time it is intense and I sweat. I can&#8217;t wash my hair every day. It is bad for my hair, scalp and it takes a long time to wash and then dry.  
I say sweat is just salt water. It&#8217;s not a big deal. And if it is really an issue use dry shampoo. [Sweat is primarily water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration).  
I did a little research to see what was out there on washing your hair every day or skipping. There wasn&#8217;t a lot out there, but [College Fashion](http://www.collegefashion.net/beauty-and-hair/how-often-should-you-wash-your-hair/) has a little info. I tried to find something on sweating and working out and what that does to your hair. Every link I found talked about African American hair. So that really isn&#8217;t helpful for me, but [here is one link](http://clutchmagonline.com/2010/07/the-sweat-out-does-your-hair-stop-you-from-working-out/) I liked what it said and I think can work for any type of hair.
