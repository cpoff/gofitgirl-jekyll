    Like Baby, I don&#8217;t belong in the corner. I am out of the corner and against the wall with Headstand.

One of the greatest things about practicing yoga is that it is always a practice and you continually grow and change.  
I talked about [my yoga breakthrough](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/11/yoga-breakthrough/) last week.  
Me getting up into &#8220;corner&#8221; [Salamba Sirsasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/481) (Headstand) was a huge step for me in my practice both physically,  mentally and emotionally.  
I questioned how I could be a yoga teacher when I couldn&#8217;t go into a full Headstand or Handstand.  
Yea, that was my own insecurities with my practice.  
After inverting in the corner about 15 times I decided to ditch the corner.  
On Sunday I went for supported Headstand against a flat wall.  
And, all be damn, I did it.  
I can&#8217;t express the feeling I have when I completely invert. It is still so new. But it is exciting. And talk about working many body parts. My triceps have been sore. But I still want to keep trying to get up. It feels like a huge accomplishment for me.  
I still have work to do to improve my Headstand, especially before I attempt it with no wall support.  
I have been working with another teacher get into [Adho Mukha Vrksasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/788) (Handstand). That one definitely scares me more than Headstand. But Aviva is doing an awesome job to work with me to get there.  
Her approach is to start in the [L Pose](http://hillarysyogapractice.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/img_1953.JPG). And step by step work into the pose, like the link below shows.  
[Sensational Yoga Poses](http://www.sensational-yoga-poses.com/l-shaped-handstand.html) has a great article, tutorial and pictures to show the process of starting in L pose and then inverting step by step.  
The main difference between Aviva&#8217;s approach and the Sensational Yoga approach is that Aviva doesn&#8217;t have me kick my legs into the pose. She instructs us to just lift one leg at a time. So far I can get one leg up.
