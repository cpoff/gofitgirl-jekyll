I was able to hit the noon spin class today. I have to say if I make the time to leave work it works out really well. I felt so good and ready to take on anything (or just about anything) once I returned to work for the afternoon.  
As long as I don&#8217;t have a meeting in the way I plan on attending that class as often as I can. It is nice to leave work and come home instead of having to head to the gym.  
Since my morning yoga class was canceled I am spending almost every evening after work at the gym. It kinda sucks. So it is nice to have my work out over with before the work day even ends.  
I am still counting the calories and working out 5-6 times a week. The weight loss has been slow. But the number is still going down, even if it isn&#8217;t a quick as I would like.
