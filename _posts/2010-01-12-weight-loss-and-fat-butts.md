I did a weigh-in yesterday. Lost 1.6 pounds. I had planned to count my calories the past week but quit after breakfast on Day 1. But I was careful about what I ate and was conscious of my consumption. Apparently that made a difference. (I was surprised, too, since I didn&#8217;t get to work out as much as I would have liked last week&#8211;2 days of yoga and a night of dancing.)  
One of my friends on Facebook posted a link to a story titled [Fat Butts May Be Healthy](http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20100112/sc_livescience/fatbuttsmaybehealthy). It&#8217;s an interesting read. No matter how much weight I lose I will always have a big butt and hips.
