Recently a few people have mentioned to me that they didn&#8217;t realize the Go Fit Girl! posts I was linking to on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GoFitGirl) were written by me. I think they just thought I was posting these awesome blog writings from this awesome person known as Go Fit Girl! Well, that is true, right?  
So for those of you don&#8217;t know who I am, here is a little bit about me: Go Fit Girl! aka Ann:  
A little more than four years ago I lost 30 pounds.  
Most of my life I have been considered &#8220;skinny&#8221;. (I hate that word.) Once I hit 25 and sat at a desk for 8+ hours a shift I started to develop OA (office ass). (Kate, thanks for that term. I use it often.)  
The first 20 pounds I lost were just from counting Points® with Weight Watchers®, which is essentially counting calories. So with reducing my caloric and fat intake I lost weight.  
The last 10 pounds lost were with counting Points® and exercise.  
I love food. And I live in an amazing part of the U.S. where I can experience all kinds of foods and restaurants. (Like tonight, The Husband and I are having dinner with friends at [Homeroom](http://homeroom510.com/)&#8211;mac & cheese restaurant.)  
I have learned to love my body: big butt, hips and all. I know that I will never have a yoga booty or 6-pack abs. And I am OK with that.  
I also love booze: wine; beer; gin and tonics; margaritas; daiquiris &#8230; I could go on and on. But I think you get the idea.  
I love to travel and see new and different places. And one of the great things about traveling is the food and alcoholic beverages.  
I started this blog after I attended a blogging conference and learned about [Dooce](http://dooce.com/). The writer and her husband can both work from home because the ads on her blog make enough money. They both, of course, still work. They just get to do what they love and with a really great schedule.  
Curt and I toyed with various ideas on what my blog could be about. Knitting &#8230; no, I can&#8217;t write enough about knitting. But health and wellness for the regular, average woman (and men&#8211;for my male readers) &#8230; I can write plenty. And believe me, the ideas just keep flowing. Not sure if I will ever run out of ideas.  
After I lost my 30 pounds I had to get an almost completely new wardrobe. Closets in the Bay Area pose many challenges. I got rid of my bigger clothes for three reasons: I don&#8217;t have enough room in my closet; I didn&#8217;t want them as a crutch; and they were all good quality stuff that I could donate to someone else who could use them.  
I don&#8217;t like to exercise. But I exercise almost every day. I do so for a variety of reasons: I don&#8217;t want to gain my weight back; I like to eat and drink&#8211;so need to counteract that; I want to be healthy; I like how I feel after a good cardio or yoga workout; I still want to fit in my clothes; exercise is a great stress reliever.  
I&#8217;m a stress eater, which can be dangerous.  
My main exercises of choice are spin and yoga (with some abs and weights sprinkled in).  
I hate cooking. So I am always trying to find easy and healthy ways to make dinner. I love my rice cooker/steamer.  
I am sure I am missing a thing or two or 100. If you want to ask me a question or many questions, feel free in the comments. If you don&#8217;t want to write in the comments, though I really wish you would, you can e-mail me at ann@gofitgirl.com.
