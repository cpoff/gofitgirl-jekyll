At the gym tonight one of my fellow gym-goers said to me, You&#8217;ve lost weight.  
I thanked Rona. But I told her that my weight is actually going in the other direction. Her husband, Jim, mentioned the whole thing about muscle weighing more than fat. I have always thought that was a myth. I mean a pound of feathers weighs the same as a pound of bricks, right?  
I used Google to learn a little more and [found this](http://www.onemorebite-weightloss.com/muscle-to-fat.html). Muscle and fat weigh the same. But the difference is: &#8220;A five pound pile of fat will take up more space (volume) than a five pound pile of muscle.&#8221;  
I was so tired after work. I really didn&#8217;t want to go to the gym. But I knew I needed to exercise. I got to the gym and Zumba was canceled. The instructor was sick. I don&#8217;t really like the Wednesday night spin teacher, plus I didn&#8217;t have my clip shoes. So I caught up on celebrity news and worked out on the elliptical. After my workout I found out that the spin class had a sub.
