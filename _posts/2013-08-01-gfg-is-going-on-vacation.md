OK, so you already thought I was on vacation, right?  
Every week I think life is gonna slow down and it just seems to get more hectic.  
This means certain things in my life suffer, such as regular exercise and blogging.  
And starting Friday I am on vacation.  
Curt and I are heading to [Turks and Caicos](http://www.clubmed.us/cm/resort-turkoise-turks-caicos_p-115-l-US-v-TURC-ac-vh.html) for a week of beach, sun, drinking and other fun and cool stuff.  
The Club Med resort offers all sorts of exercise, including trampoline and trapeze, which I am super excited about.  
I am sure you will get a post or two out of me while away. But if not, don&#8217;t worry, I will be back to a regular routine soon. (That&#8217;s what I keep telling myself anyway.)  
There will be no August Monthly Challenge as I haven&#8217;t had time to work on one. Plus I need some more participation from my friends/readers/challengers in order to justify me taking time to work on those. That&#8217;s a HINT. ðŸ™‚
