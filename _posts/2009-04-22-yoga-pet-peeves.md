These are more things that other people do to make my yoga experience a little less pleasant.  
**Late-comers:** OK, when you are late to yoga class you should really wait until meditation is over before coming in (it&#8217;s what I do). But if you have to come in do it quietly. Take your shoes off, don&#8217;t clomp around. Set up as quietly as possible. It drives me nuts when people are dropping things on the hardwood floor.  
**Weight droppers:** I do yoga in a gym. So you are gonna hear the music and other stuff. But sometimes during [Savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482) someone in the gym will drop a huge weight to the floor. They do it other times, too. But it is most disturbing during Savasana. The ground shakes. It feels like we are having an earthquake.  
**Right or left:** This isn&#8217;t really a pet peeve. But my Monday/Wednesday morning yoga teacher mixes up the left and right a lot. We will be on the right and I am thinking, didn&#8217;t we just do the right side? Sometimes I am confused which way I should be twisting. That is really my only complaint about Sarah. And I have to say if I was the yoga instructor I would be messing up the left and right all the time.
