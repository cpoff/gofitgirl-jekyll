I realized when I got to work today I had plenty of healthy snacks to keep me going for the week. And it wasn&#8217;t even all planned.  
I did have a yogurt and some light butter popcorn today. I also had some blueberries and strawberries. I still have carrots, edamame (leftovers from dinner last night) and various fresh fruit.  
I love summer fruit. The blueberries right now are so good. I also have cherries, peaches, apples, blackberries and strawberries as I mentioned before.  
If you plan right you can have plenty of healthy, low calorie and filling snacks available at any time you feel snacky.
