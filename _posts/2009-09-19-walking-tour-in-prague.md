Curt and I hired a tour guide, Eva, yesterday to give us a walking tour of Prague. When she first proposed 6 hours we kinda balked at it and said we would see how we were feeling at 4-5 hours. Well, we were with Eva for six hours.  
We, of course, didn&#8217;t walk the entire six hours. There was a lunch break and lots of stops to look at things and for her to point at things here and there&#8211;which was really cool. No guide book or group tour would do that.  
Our tour ended at a monastery with &#8230; beer. Man, that beer was good. Eva said, in her opinion, it is the best beer in Prague. I think she was right.  
We walked so much that my calves and one knee are hurting. Thank goodness for Aleve.  
Today some more walking, but a lot less and much more causual.
