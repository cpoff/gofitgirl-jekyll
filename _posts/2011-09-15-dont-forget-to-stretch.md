    Stretching after my 30 minutes of cardio. Look closely, you can see me in the mirror. I am doing a Downward Dog.

Wow, I was feeling yesterday&#8217;s gym class today. My butt, legs and arm sockets? (I guess it&#8217;s part of the [pectoral muscles](http://www.tptherapy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/chest-front.jpg)) were sore today.  
It was a pretty busy day in the office today. I had to keep myself on track and get a lot done with the goal of taking the 4:15 shuttle home and hopefully making it to the gym as well.  
Mission accomplished: I got what I had to get done today; I made the 4:15 shuttle; and I got some gym time in. I didn&#8217;t get to workout as long as I wanted. But seriously, what did I expect?  
I did 30 minutes of cardio: hills on the spin bike on Level 5. I usually do Level 7. But My butt and legs were really feeling it. So I didn&#8217;t want to over do it.  
After my cardio I did about 15 minutes of stretching. I hardly ever take that much time to stretch. I think most people probably don&#8217;t stretch as long as they should, including stretching before and after a workout.  
[Just In Time Wellness](http://www.justintimewellness.com/articles/articles/why_is_it_important_to_stretch?/) talks about why stretching is so important. This [article is very detailed on stretching and flexibility&#8211;How to Stretch](http://www.cmcrossroads.com/bradapp/docs/rec/stretching/stretching_5.html). The [stretching chart here](http://www.musclesprod.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/stretch.gif) gives a pretty good stretching routine for full body stretching.
