Curt and I were in Missouri over the weekend visiting his parents.  
On Thursday, the day before we left town, I weighed in. And I weighed in today&#8211;day after we came back. I gained 2 pounds.  
Musta been the fried shrimp dinner and beers at the Ground Round in St. Joe; or fried tenderloin sandwiches; or the homemade (from scratch) pumpkin pie; or the homemade apple crisp; or the enchiladas; or the eggs and bacon at Poppa&#8217;s; or the many glasses of wine; or the cream cheese shrimp appetizer &#8230;  
Ed, my father-in-law, said he wanted to make sure I left Albany heavier than when I arrived. Ha! Well, it is a done deal, Ed.  
But I had some amazing meals&#8211;home cooking, good Midwestern comfort food. And it was a great visit with the in-laws.  
I really pushed myself in spin today&#8211;knowing I gotta work off those 2 pounds plus .2 to get back to my goal weight.
