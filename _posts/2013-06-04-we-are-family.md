    My beautiful Granita at my wedding almost 10 years ago. She died two days later on her 96th birthday. I believe she waited for me to get married before she went.

I was born, bred and educated in Tucson, Ariz. I left about two weeks after I graduated from college when I was 23.  
Most of my family members never leave Tucson. So it was a big deal for me to leave and move somewhere where I knew no one. But for the sake of my career and to really grow up and blossom I had to take that step.  
[Previously I have written](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9467) about how lucky I was as a little girl to have three great-grandmas, two grandmas and two grandpas. Apparently when I was a sassy little thing (nope, haven&#8217;t out grown that) my parents would say to me, we are going to visit grandma. And I would say (sweetly, I am sure), which one?  
So most of them got nicknames from little Annie Chihak. My dad&#8217;s mom announced that she would be called Nana before her first grandchild (me) was born. My mom&#8217;s parents were named Grandma and Grandpa Lisa because my Aunt Lisa lived with them. My dad&#8217;s grandma was Grandma Chihak (I don&#8217;t think I made that one up myself). My dad&#8217;s dad was Grandpa Frank. (I have a feeling I didn&#8217;t make that one up either.) My mom&#8217;s two grandmas both had dogs, one named Chula (which means pretty) and the other named Peanut. So they became Grandma Chula and Grandma Peanut. At some point I started calling Grandma Peanut Granita because really, who wants to call their grandma a peanut?  
I am still lucky in my life to have two grandparents. Grandpa Frank (my dad&#8217;s dad) is 91 and Grandma Lisa (my mom&#8217;s mom), who we just call Grandma these days, is 84.  
I have been struggling with the idea that I will likely not visit Tucson this year. (I was there three times last year&#8211;two planned and the other visit was when my grandpa had to have surgery.)  
My mom knows that this has been weighing on me recently. She has assured me that I am a good daughter and granddaughter and I go above and beyond with my grandparents.  
But I still feel some guilt.  
The other day she told me something my grandma said about me. I always remember her on her birthday and Mother&#8217;s Day. I send her cards and gifts and check in and I don&#8217;t forget about her. (I don&#8217;t call her because she never answers the phone.) She thinks the reason I send her stuff, check in and try to visit as often as possible is because I am worried she is gonna die. Does she know something I don&#8217;t?  
I regularly call my grandpa. Man, that man loves to chat. We always have a great conversation. I also make sure to send him cards on Father&#8217;s Day and gifts on his birthday and occasionally an old school letter.  
I love my family and I love Tucson. But visiting Tucson can be stressful.  
I haveÂ divorced parents. And a large family.  
When you haven&#8217;t left you don&#8217;t quite understand the exhaustion and challenges that occur when coming home for a visit.  
In the past few years I have changed the way I visit. I make sure to see my grandparents and my parents and anyone else is cherry on top. Family is always welcome at my mom&#8217;s or when I am visiting my grandparents. I know both appreciate extra visits from family.  
My family is the most important thing to me. They can stress me out and drive me nuts. But they are mine and I love them.
