**Nothing tastes as good as being thin feels.**  
So I made my WW goal today and then some. To reach my goal weight of 125 I had to lose 1.2 pounds. I lost 1.8 pounds for a total loss of 30.2 pounds. (And I was out of town this weekend eating out and drinking and I was still able to stay within my points.)  
So, all of you haters and food pushers can step off! ðŸ™‚
