So last week [I talked about how I just had 5 pounds to lose](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=3515), which doesn&#8217;t sound like much, right?  
I hadn&#8217;t weighed myself in about a week and soon after that I weighed myself. I had 7 pounds to lose at that point. Women tend to fluctuate with weight. So who knows.  
But anyway, I weighed myself this week and I am on track with losing weight. I now have about 4 pounds to lose to be back at my goal weight.  
I just need to be diligent with my exercise and especially with my calorie intake. And challenges always seem to come up. All I can do is my best.
