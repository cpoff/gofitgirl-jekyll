I started running. Yesterday.  
I had been fast walking for about 4 weeks. So I told myself April was when I started running.  
It wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought. I still felt a little akward while running. I am not exactly the most graceful and coordinated person.  
But I started out walking for 5 mins. Then I would run for a minute, walk for 2, run for a minute, etc. The last 3 minutes I walked. I was all sweaty and gross. But I felt good afterward.  
My goal is to eventually run the whole 30 minutes. Once I am better I will run sans treadmill. There is a beautiful path along the Bay right near work. So eventually I will take my running out there. For now it is the good ol&#8217; treadmill.
