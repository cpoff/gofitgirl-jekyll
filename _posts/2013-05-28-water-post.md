    Water helps keep hydration in balance when consuming caffeine and alcohol.

One of the challenges in this month&#8217;s [Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10531) was to concentrate on water intake.  
Water is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Keeping yourself hydrated is a vital part of life. Water makes up 60 percent of your body weight, [according to USGS](http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/propertyyou.html).  
There is varying information on how much water each person should drink. At the very least six servings a day should be consumed. I have read eight servings is essential. (A serving is 8 ounces.)  
I have also read that whatever your weight is, let&#8217;s say 140 pounds, you should drink half your weight in water. So for my example, 80 ounces a day.  
If you drink caffeine and/or alcohol it is important to stay hydrated. If you exercise consider increasing your water intake somewhat as well.  
According to a [Mayo Clinic article](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283), water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells and provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues. &#8230; Even mild dehydration can drain your energy and make you tired.  
Most of us probably experience mild symptoms when dehydrated such as low energy, headache and thirst. But there are severe complications that can come with being dehydrated.  
[According to this EMedicine Health article](http://www.emedicinehealth.com/dehydration_in_adults/article_em.htm), mild and often even moderate dehydration can be reversed or put back in balance by oral intake of fluids that contain electrolytes (or salts) that are lost during activity. If unrecognized and untreated, some instances of moderate and severe dehydration can lead to death.  
[Another Mayo Clinic article](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/dehydration/DS00561/DSECTION=complications) lists severe complications, which includes death as well as heat injury; swelling of the brain; seizures; low blood volume shock; kidney failure; coma and death.  
I know almost immediately when I am dehydrated. I feel thirsty and usually have a headache.  
Drinking water keeps me healthy and hydrated. The only negative side effect is that drinking lots of water makes you pee a lot. But that seems like such a minor inconvenience compared to those nasty symptoms listed above.
