After about a week and a half I went back to spin today.  
The class was tough. But it was good to be there. I could only stay for spin (no abs/core or body conditioning) since I was heading to a baseball game with Curt, my grandpa and my dad.  
Over the past work week meetings, work, getting ready for guests, having guests got in the way of my gym time.  
I was out of town last weekend. And you know what happens when out of town and having guests visiting: lots of eating out and little gym time.
