As a real full-fledged grownup (though I really still feel like a kid most of the time) I have worked for only two companies: Gannett and Onyx Pharmaceuticals.  
I worked in newspapers (Statesman Journal in Salem, Ore. and The Arizona Republic in Phoenix) for seven years as an editor.  
A little more than seven years ago Curt and I moved to the Bay Area. I signed up with a temp agency and ended up at Onyx helping with filing in the Legal Department. I became a full-time employee in October 2005. I am still in the Legal Department working with the same boss seven years later.  
In December 2005,Â [Nexavar was approved in kidney cancer](http://www.nexavar-us.com/scripts/pages/en/patient/nexavar-and-kidney-cancer/). Onyx and Bayer collaborate on this compound. I still remember our small Onyx team standing in the kitchen of the 12th floor building in Emeryville toasting to our success. A few years later Nexavar was approved in a [second cancer, liver](http://www.nexavar-us.com/scripts/pages/en/patient/nexavar-and-liver-cancer/).  
On Friday, July 20, [KYPROLIS](http://kyprolis.com/) received accelerated approval by the FDA in [multiple myeloma](http://www.themmrf.org/living-with-multiple-myeloma/newly-diagnosed-patients/what-is-multiple-myeloma/), which is a blood cancer. Today we had all kinds of celebrations at work.

It&#8217;s hard to describe the feelings going through me today: pride, giddiness, happy, celebratory, exhaustion, amazement, gratitude &#8230;  
And we have all been affected by cancer. Someone we love has had it and beaten it or, unfortunately, some of the people we love have lost the battle.  
I have always been proud of the work I do, my team does and Onyx does. But today was one of the most amazing days of my career at Onyx. It doesn&#8217;t come along too often that a company gets a drug approved by the FDA.  
Today I was reminded why I come to work every day. Why I get up at 5:30 a.m. and endure a long commute. Why I work some crazy hours. Why I skip many lunch breaks. Why I try to manage and juggle many projects at once. Days like today make it all worthwhile.  
I am proud to say Onyx continues to help patients with cancer. And patients are our No. 1 priority.
