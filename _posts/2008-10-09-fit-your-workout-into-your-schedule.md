Today is my birthday. So I am not going into work. And normally on Thursdays I go to kickboxing class after work. But not today. I will be eating sushi then.  
So since I am home this morning, I did a yoga workout through my digital cable. Exercise TV has a ton of options, from cardio to yoga to pilates. Pretty much anything you want, it is there. And they change out the &#8220;videos&#8221; every so often so you get variety. It&#8217;s pretty cool.  
So I still made sure that I got my workout in and fit it into my schedule today.  
Shortly I am off for some shopping, lunch with Mia and then a massage!
