Today in Zumba, the class was not quite as full. (I think summer vacations are a factor.) I realized at certain times I was totally in my own world and not thinking about the people around me. Usually I am a little more aware and making sure I am not crashing into someone or stepping on their feet or something.  
It was a good workout&#8211;as always. I am still slow at getting some of the steps. But I am getting better and more comfortable every class.  
And we had our first guy in the class, which has been going on for five weeks.
