    My spicy Thai-style stir fry for lunch last week.
  </p>
</div>

  
Most weeks I try to explore at least one &#8220;new&#8221; recipe.  
I was looking at Hungry Girl&#8217;s website and found [spicy Thai-style no-cook stir-fry](http://www.hungry-girl.com/weighin/show/2065-healthy-summer-recipes-thai-no-cook-stir-fry-italian-tuna-salad-wrap-stuffed-tomatoes).  
It sounded yummy so I decided to give it a try.  
I added the ingredients I didn&#8217;t already have to my grocery list. I decided to add a few other ingredients to it as well.  
When I got home I realized I forgot to write a few things down.  
I modified the recipe a bit and had it for lunch three times last week. Yup, I thought it was really yummy. I really enjoyed it. It&#8217;s filling and fairly healthy.  
The HG version is fine. I just made some adjustments because of what I had on hand.  
I didn&#8217;t buy broccoli coleslaw and decided to add rice to make it more substantial. As I was grabbing veggies out of the fridge I realized I did have some broccoli coleslaw. So that got thrown in as well. HG&#8217;s version is cold and mine is hot.  
Here&#8217;s my spicy Thai-style stir fry:

  * 2-3 oz. of chicken (I cut up a chicken breast and cooked it up in a skillet.)
  * 1/2 cup of brown rice
  * 1/2 cup to 1 cup broccoli coleslaw
  * 1/4 cup of onion
  * 1/4 cup of bell pepper of your choice (My favorite are red peppers.)
  * 1/4 cup mushrooms
  * 1/8 cup of water chestnuts
  * 1 tbsp of garlic
  * 1-2 tbsp of peanut sauce
  * Dash of rice vinegar
  * Red peppers flakes if you want to make it spicy

Use cooking spray in your skillet. Throw the garlic in and get it heated and then add the chicken. Cook the chicken. (You can always add a little salt and pepper to the chicken as it is cooking.) Add all of your cut up veggies and cook until they are soft. I threw my 1/2 cup of rice in the skillet and got it warmed up. (It was already cooked. I like using the [Trader Joe&#8217;s organic brown rice](http://cooktj.com/node/706).) Add red pepper flakes (add as much or as little as you want).  
Once everything was cooked and heated I removed the skillet from the heat and added the peanut sauce and rice vinegar.  
Throw it all into a bowl and enjoy!  
Since I was making this for myself for lunch my recipe is for one serving. Double things up for two servings, triple for three &#8230; You get the idea.  
You can, of course, add or take out any veggies as you see fit. If you don&#8217;t eat chicken you could do shrimp or even tofu.

I love cornbread.  
And Jiffy has created easy access to make and eat cornbread pretty much whenever you want.  
But Hungry Girl has her own version, which she calls [cheesy-good cornbread muffins](http://www.hungry-girl.com/newsletters/raw/919-low-calorie-corn-muffin-mashed-potato-and-vegetarian-tamale-pie-recipes).  
And yes, these are cheesy and good.  
I love to have them with my dinner or just as a snack.  
They can get moldy pretty quick. So I like to keep them in the fridge or you could even freeze them.  
A quick zap in the microwave and you have a warm and yummy snack.
