    My new little badass shredder, which does an amazing job of shredding piles and piles of paperwork.

In my massive de-cluttering project a big part of it is the shredding. Ugh, oh, the shredding.  
The shredder I had before was old and tired. And the shredding was very slow going.  
So on Thursday night I headed to Office Depot and bought a new shredder. I was willing to pay 100 bucks for a new shredder. I found a &#8220;medium duty&#8221; shredder, which was originally $100, but on sale for $60. Nice deal.  
(By the way, the shredders at Office Depot seem to be on sale until the end of March.)  
My new shredder can shred 12 sheets at once and it does so quickly. I did some shredding on Friday. And yesterday, that thing went to town. I finished all the shredding I needed to yesterday. I had planned to shred all weekend and possibly a few more weekends.

    The shredder bits made it to my yoga mat at the studio.

It&#8217;s a good thing I didn&#8217;t have to do any shredding today as I am a complete zombie with the Spring Forward.  
When I got back from yoga today I was so tired. I lounged watching some taped TV I needed to catch up on. And then I took a nap. I am still feeling a little zombie-like.  
With all the shredding going on in the his house the paper bits have made it all over the house: living room, bedroom, bathroom,Â etc.  
I went to yoga on Friday evening. I laid out my mat and went to go get my props. When I got back to my mat I noticed two little shredder paper bits. It made me chuckle and, of course, I had to take a picture (to the right).
