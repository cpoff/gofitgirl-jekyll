    As I had stated before I got the last Comment Contest Tuesday post idea from a friend on Facebook. She received many more comments when she posed the question: W<strong>hat do you eat when you’re feeling very snacky but don’t need (or want) to consume a bunch of calories/fat?</strong>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    And I am gonna share some of the answers she received:
