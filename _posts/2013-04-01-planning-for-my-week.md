I work hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It&#8217;s a choice I have to face every single day.  
And part of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is planning. Planning is a big part of my success with clean living. (I plan out meals and my exercise.)  
Sunday mornings are my normal day to hit the grocery. And I did yesterday. I stocked up on fresh fruits and veggies and other items to keep me going for the week.  
If I have time and motivation on Sundays I will cook up a few things for the week.  
Sometimes during the week I will make a meal with two servings so I have a lunch later in the week as well. Which is what I did tonight.  
Many times I make Sunday mornings my chopping day&#8211;where I chop up veggies for the week, whether for snacks or a stir fry or a meal.  
My friend Monica recently mentioned to me that on Sundays she bags up her snack carrots for the week. I don&#8217;t know why I hadn&#8217;t thought of that before. (I usually bag my carrots and get my lunch ready the night before.)  
So yesterday I bagged up my carrots for the week. I made brown rice for the week in my awesome little rice cooker. I steamed eggplant for a lunch and dinner this week (while making the rice). I boiled whole wheat penne pasta and cooked up some garbanzo beans for three meals this week with this [Yoga Journal recipe](http://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/food/recipes/recipe/11930). And I also made a [kale salad](http://www.wholeliving.com/210932/dr-weils-kale-salad), which I had for lunch yesterday and will eat throughout the week. (I had it as a side salad with my lunch today.)  
My exercise plan this week is: Monday: body conditioning at the gym (did it and I think I am gonna be sore!); Tuesday: Hatha yoga at yoga studio; Wednesday: Hatha yoga at studio; Thursday: spin at gym; Friday: body conditioning at gym; Saturday: spin at gym; Sunday: Vinyasa yoga at studio.  
I also went back to tracking my food and exercise this week, which always helps keep me on track and honest.  
Another thing I do on Sundays is get my work clothes ready and ironed for the week. It sounds crazy. But believe me, it helps. Especially since my time is limited in the evenings. I get my gym and yoga clothes ready for the week as well.  
LIfe happens and I know plans change. This week is going to pose some challenges. But I am armed with my plan and I will stick to it as much as I can.
