    My no-party ballot wasn&#8217;t especially exciting. But I still voted in the Oregon primary. (In Oregon you vote by mail.)

Today is primary election day in Oregon.  
I&#8217;m a political person to a point.  
The first election I was able to vote in was when Bill Clinton ran for President in 1992. I was proud that Arizona went blue in 1996 for Bill&#8217;s second run.  
At some point I changed my party from Democrat to no party.  
I decided to become no party as a journalist. And I&#8217;ve kept it that way ever since.  
In Oregon I can&#8217;t vote in the primary this time around. (That could change soon.) And I decided not to change my political party for the primary. That was my decision alone. And anyone who did change their party to vote, good for you. I decided that wasn&#8217;t best for me.  
Even within the Democratic party I am tired and annoyed of all the bashing on both sides.  
And I won&#8217;t even go into how I feel about that Republican nominee. Except to say being childish, mean-spirited racist, a xenophobe, a misogynist, lacking any sort of political experience &#8230; does notÂ make a U.S. President &#8230; even a really bad one.  
I am a woman. I am Mexican-American. I live in Oregon. I am an Arizona (and Tucson) native. I am a liberal. I am pro-choice. I believe in hard work. I believe in being a good human being and caring for and helping others.  
I know who I like for President and what I think is not going to change anyone else&#8217;s mind.  
But because I can&#8217;t vote in the primary I am just going with the flow.  
In November, regardless who&#8217;s on the ballot I will be voting blue.
