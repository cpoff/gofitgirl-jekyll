That was the theme today in my yoga class.  
I hadn&#8217;t worked out since Wednesday, with work being so busy and then being out of town. So today seemed a little tougher than usual.  
Sarah, the regular Mon/Wed a.m. yoga instructor, was back today after being out for about five weeks.  
I don&#8217;t have very good balance. But it has been getting better. I have gotten much better at [tree pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496). But today I just sucked at it! Usually I get frustrated with myself when I can&#8217;t hold a balancing pose. But today I really didn&#8217;t.  
Another pose we did was the [dancer pose](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/936). I was much better with that one.  
And the last pose I want to mention is [crane](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/468). I have actually done this pose fully before&#8211;like once. You have to have a really strong core for this pose.
