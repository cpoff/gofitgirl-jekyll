While in Europe I pretty much ate and drank whatever I wanted. I do believe when you are on vacation one should enjoy themselves: enjoy the culture. And a lot of that has to do with the food and alcoholic beverages. One good thing about Europe is there is a lot of walking.  
But my vacation is over. And it is time to get back on track and that started today.  
I woke up nice and early&#8211;gotta love that jet lag. I went to yoga and ran a couple of errands. (I took today off from work&#8211;will go back tomorrow.)  
I also have started eating much better. I soy latte and oatmeal for breakfast; Brussels sprouts and brown rice for lunch. Not sure what&#8217;s for dinner yet.  
I plan to weigh-in tomorrow and see what kind of damage I did. Though I am not too worried. Whatever &#8230; I am now back on track and that is all that matters.
