Sundays are my off day from the gym or really from any sort of exercise.  
But today I went to the gym and worked out on the elliptical. This week is going to be crazy with lots of stuff happening at work, in the evenings personally and with Curt and I traveling to Missouri on Friday.  
So I thought I better get my workouts in when I can.  
Plus I got to read about how Jennifer Love Hewitt lost 18 pounds in 10 weeks in Us Weekly.
