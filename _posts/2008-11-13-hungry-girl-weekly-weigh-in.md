I get [Hungry Girl&#8217;s](http://www.hungry-girl.com/) daily newsletters. I don&#8217;t always read them. I get overwhelmed by all my e-mail sometimes.  
But today I read [HG&#8217;s Weekly Weigh-In](http://www.hungry-girl.com/week/weeklydetails.php?isid=1597).  
And there were tips for making some healthier versions of foods for our upcoming food fest we call Thanksgiving.  
I think I am going to try the recipe for the [pumpkin pie](http://www.hungry-girl.com/tuesdaypreview.php?newsletterid=1261). It seems pretty easy. And I know what all the ingredients are.  
Hungry Girl answers questions, gives tips, healthier versions to recipes, etc. And you can be friends with her on Facebook, too. ðŸ™‚
