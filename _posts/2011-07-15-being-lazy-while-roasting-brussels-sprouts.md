    My dinner tonight: Brussels sprouts roasted in the oven mixed with brown rice.
  </p>
</div>

  
I decided to be &#8220;lazy&#8221; and not go to yoga tonight. I just wasn&#8217;t feeling it. I just feel tired. So I decided to just hang on the couch and watch some episodes of Parenthood and drink wine.  
For dinner I made Brussels sprouts. I normally make them in the rice cooker/steamer. But I decided to try a [recipe my cousin Alison posted on her blog](http://eatdrinkbeskinny.blogspot.com/2011/06/recipe-roasted-brussels-sprouts.html). They came out pretty yummy. I still like my method of steaming them until they are squishy and I mix them with brown rice a little better. But roasting them in the oven was a great alternative. And the house didn&#8217;t get as stinky either.  
I pretty much like all vegetables. There are very few I don&#8217;t like. And I love finding new and easy ways to cook them. I don&#8217;t enjoy cooking and I don&#8217;t have a lot of time for it. My time is pretty limited with my commute, work, hitting the gym or yoga studio and making sure I get a decent amount of sleep every night.
