It has been about 72 hours since I have had a piece of candy. If I had to choose between something sweet or something salty I would go for the salt.  
But there are times I just can&#8217;t stop eating chocolate, especially if that chocolate has some peanut butter mixed in.  
One of my friends/co-workers gave up candy for [Lent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent). Â I have a candy bowl on my desk. Last weekend I bought new candy for the bowl as the pickins were slim. I brought the candy in on Wednesday. Another co-worker brought in a HUGE bag of Easter candy for the bowl&#8211;almost 4 pounds worth of chocolately goodness.  
I had about four pieces of chocolate on Wednesday. On Wednesday evening I was thinking and decided to join my friend in the not eating candy challenge. I am a non-practicing Catholic. I don&#8217;t observe Lent.  
But I decided to take on the challenge of no candy for 39 days (since I started a day late).  
This way we both have support in our challenge. I think we can do it. The challenge isn&#8217;t as difficult for me at home as it is as work. My work candy bowl is overflowing (at the moment) with delicious chocolates.

    Colombian candies at home.

We don&#8217;t really have much candy at home. But we do have some Colombian candies our friends Esteban and Loesje gave us. I probably have one or two a week. They are so yummy. So I will have to get out of the habit of eating the candies at home.  
But really, work will be the challenge. I eat (and especially chocolate) when I am bored, stressed, tired, hungry, not hungry, happy, upset, angry, sad &#8230; You see the problem?
