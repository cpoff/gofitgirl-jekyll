As we have entered September and we start to say goodbye to Summer and hello to Fall I have some **BIG NEWS** to share:

I was born, bred and educated in Tucson, Arizona. I left the Old Pueblo almost 21 years ago. Well ... it's time for me to come home.  

The Husband and I are packaging up and moving back to Arizona (where it is Summer almost all year round).  
This wasn't an easy decision, but it feels right. I'm happy to be coming home.  

I love the life I have created in Portland, the friends I have reconnected with, the new friends I have made and the most amazing and best yoga and cycle students.  

I miss my family. I miss Tucson. I miss Arizona Winters. I miss Arizona monsoon season. For the record I don't miss Arizona Summers&#8211;but can't win them all. Which is why I am not moving there in the summer.  

​I will be teaching all of my regular classes through the end of September. If you can, please make it to a class with me. Find my <a href="http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/" data-cke-saved-href="http://gofitgirl.com/yoga-classes/">full schedule here</a>.  
I hope you will continue to follow my happenings in the [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/gofitgirl), my blog and on social media.  

​I will be back in Portland on occasion as I am still in my advanced yoga teacher training, which is located in Beaverton/Portland, and I will finish it (June 2019) to become an RYT 500 (registered yoga teacher with 500 hours of teacher training).  
​
If you have been a student of mine (in Portland or elsewhere) and would like to write me a <a href="http://gofitgirl.com/testimonials/" data-cke-saved-href="http://gofitgirl.com/testimonials/">testimonial</a> I would be most grateful. You can e-mail your testimonial to me at <a href="mailto:ann@gofitgirl.com?subject=Testimonial" data-cke-saved-href="mailto:ann@gofitgirl.com?subject=Testimonial">ann@gofitgirl.com</a>. I am happy to identify you any way you are comfortable.
