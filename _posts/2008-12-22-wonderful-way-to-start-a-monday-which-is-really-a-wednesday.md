well, I only have three days of work this week. So today is Wednesday for me, right?  
Anyway, had yoga this morning. We had a sub named Brian. (Oh, the teacher who has taken over the classes, Sarah, is really great.)  
Brian was really good, too. There were only two of us in class. He took the time to adjust us or talk us through holding the pose correctly. He had us hold the poses longer than normal, which is good and bad. Good for your body&#8211;but I don&#8217;t like when my thighs or arms or whatever are burning and I don&#8217;t think I can hold the pose for one more second!  
It was a wonderful practice and I felt ready for my crazy and short week at work. Wednesday is the last day for Onyx for the year. So I am trying to get as much done as I possibly can. It&#8217;s tough. I came in 3 1/2 hours yesterday.  
Have a wonderful rest of the day!
