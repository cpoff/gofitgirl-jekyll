Man, Zumba is getting more and more fun. I am feeling more comfortable with the steps and moves. And class today seemed more intermediate than beginner.  
Maybe because it is getting a little more advanced I was really sweatin&#8217;. My shirt was drenched. I almost need to wear one of those [sweatband things](http://sportheadband.com/). (Check out [this crazy sweatband](http://www.sweatgutr.com/home.html).) I don&#8217;t really care what other people think&#8211;but I would feel like a total dork with one of those. And I already kinda feel like a dork in Zumba class. Though today I felt less dorky.
