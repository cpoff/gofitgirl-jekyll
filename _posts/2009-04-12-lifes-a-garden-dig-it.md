Curt and I put in our garden in today.  
I can&#8217;t wait for our yummy tomatoes to come in. I love to sauté them in olive oil and garlic and eat over pasta. Oh, yum. I also like to mix in my homegrown herbs in the sauté, too.  
Anyway, that hoeing is a major workout. And usually I get too tired to finish the hoeing. (Curt digs up the dirt with a shovel and I follow with the hoe.) But today I did not wimp out. Must be those body conditioning classes and the fact that I am now working with 8 lb. dumb bells.
