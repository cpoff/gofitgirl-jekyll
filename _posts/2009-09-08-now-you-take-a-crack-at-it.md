**Today I am posting a twist to Guest Post Tuesday: Comment Contest Tuesday.**

It is your turn to be a Go Fit Girl! or Go Fit Boy! for a comment. You don&#8217;t even have to write a guest post.

Your comment can be simple or complex. For example: I love ice cream!; I have abs of steel!; I want abs of steel; My morning workout and breakfast routine include &#8230;

You must comment in the comments below with at least your first name. (E-mails to me or comments on my personal blog, Facebook, etc. **_don&#8217;t_** count.) You can comment as much as you want, but you will only be entered into the contest once. If you win and I don&#8217;t have your e-mail address you will need to send it to me after the winner is announced.

You have from right now until noon Thursday. The winner will be announced Friday.

_And just to let you know, Guest Post Tuesday will return in October (hopefully) after I return from my European vacation._
