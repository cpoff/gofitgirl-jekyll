So don&#8217;t have sushi the night before your WW weigh-in (WI). In fact, it probably isn&#8217;t a good idea to have sushi two days in a row right before your WI.  
The scale said I gained two pounds. I know that I didn&#8217;t actually gain two pounds. It was water weight from the sodium. But it still sucks.  
My leader said likely next week I will have a much more drastic drop in weight.  
As they say on the WW message boards, I had a NSV (nonscale victory) with all the new clothes I bought. I mentioned my new clothing sizes in the meeting today. It was pretty exciting.  
And I received a charm for my key chain. The key chain I got when I hit my 10% goal. The charm is for losing 25 pounds (which I hit 26 last week). I got the reward this week because last week I was the only one in the meeting so it wouldn&#8217;t have been much of a celebration! Ha!  
Anyway, Erica and Casey are coming into town this weekend. So it will be a challenge to stay on track foodwise. Wish me luck.
