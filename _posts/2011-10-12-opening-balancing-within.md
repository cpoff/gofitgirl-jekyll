    The high lunge was part of our Vinyasa Flow tonight ... with eyes closed.

I attended my regular Hatha Yoga class with Baxter tonight. I really look forward to that class. He makes yoga fun while making us laugh.  
His class isn&#8217;t as intense as the other classes I take. But that&#8217;s OK. Variety is good. And don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am still working.  
Tonight Baxter asked us to try our Vinyasa Flow with our eyes closed. I am normally not steady with my eyes closed. But I went with it. Eventually Baxter had us hold some poses with our eyes closed as well. Such as [Triangle](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/494),[Warrior II](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/495), [Side Angle](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/749) and [Reverse Warrior](http://yoga.about.com/od/yogaposes/a/reversewarrior.htm).  
Baxter had us hold the poses and make adjustments and keep balance internally instead of relying on what we normally rely on. It was definitely a challenge to maintain balance (something I struggle with even with my eyes open). But I appreciated the practice of it.  
When something new is proposed in class or a pose I find difficult or dislike (such as [Happy Baby](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2497)) Â is asked of by the instructor I have recently tried to adjust my attitude or feelings toward it and stay open and appreciate it. It&#8217;s a works in progress &#8230;
