    Items I have made include what I call a scoa (that's the black furry scarf), a fun scarf (middle), warm winter scarf (horizontal) and a knitted cap.

As I sit here and type this post I am missing the New Year&#8217;s Day detox workshop at my yoga studio. Man, am I so bummed about that.  
With the cold being in my chest and me coughing I just didn&#8217;t think it was a good idea for me or fair to others attending.  
Even though I don&#8217;t get to benefit from the workshop others do. All the proceeds go to the Alameda County Food Bank. So something good still comes out of this.  
I am a huge advocate of giving to others, especially charity. I feel that I was put on this planet to help others. I get a great sense of good feelings and warm heart when I help and give to others.  
I also enjoy knitting. I make scarves, hats, slippers and blankets. (Though I am so over blankets. They take so long to knit.) And for the most part I enjoy making them for others.  
I have participated in knitting hats for the troops with [The Ship&#8217;s Project](http://www.theshipsproject.com/Home.htm). (I have made a couple of troop hats for friends&#8217; husbands.) I have knitted scarves for the [Red Scarf Project](http://fc2success.org/what-we-do/programs/red-scarf-project/). I have knitted hats for premie babies in the NICU. My friend Monica walked the 3-day Susan G. Komen 60-mile walk and asked me to make a scarf for her. I had time to make two.

    Knitted hat with glow in the dark stripes. Made one for one of my nephews and another for my cousin's son.

To keep with my theme of charity and knitting for others in 2012, here is what I propose to my readers: On a first come, first-served basis I will take requests for a hat or scarf. The requester pays for the yarn and gives $25 to a charity of my choice. (If I need to mail them, you all pay for postage.) I will take one request per person. If for some reason I get overwhelmed with requests I will have to put a limit on the requests. To request an item, please comment in the comments below or e-mail me at ann@gofitgirl.com.  
Happy New Year! And thank you for all your support to Go Fit Girl! in 2011  and for what is to come in 2012.

    Here's a shot of troop hats I made along with some friends to send to The Ship's Project and eventually to our soldiers.
