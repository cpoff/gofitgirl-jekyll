    GFG! wants some ideas from you for this week&#8217;s Comment Contest Tuesday, which lasts until May 28.
  </p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I was thinking about this month&#8217;s <a href="http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10531">Monthly Challenge</a> and how I am not super jazzed about it. And based on the participation and minimal updates I am guessing GFG! readers feel the same way.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It&#8217;s difficult to come up with exciting challenges for exercise and nutrition every single month, which I have been doing for nine months now. Sometimes the ideas are great and sometimes they are just OK.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  (My favorite so far has been going old school with hula hooping, jumping rope and jumping jacks, which was <a href="http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10354">April&#8217;s Go Fit Girl! Monthly Challenge</a>.)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So I am coming to my wonderful readers and asking you to give me ideas. What kind of challenges do you want? Do you want to challenge others? Or challenge yourself?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And to make this more fun, let&#8217;s make it a Comment Contest Tuesday.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  For every idea you post in the comments below you will get your name thrown into a hat for a drawing. So the more you comment, the better chance you get to win a prize. Please make sure to come up with both exercise and nutrition ideas.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  You can win a prize and I have some ideas to store away for future Monthly Challenges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  You have until Tuesday, May 28 noon my time (Pacific) to comment away. Only posts in the comments below will count. E-mails, Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, in-person comments don&#8217;t count.
