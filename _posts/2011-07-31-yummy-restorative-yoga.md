Today I took two yoga classes. I took my regular Sunday morning Vinyasa class with Ashley. It was tough and sweaty&#8211;great workout.  
This evening I took a Restorative class with Vickie. It was calming, relaxing and restorative.  
I want to make the restorative class a more regular occurrence. It is such a relaxing and comfy class. It is a great way to get myself ready for my pending workweek.  
In case you want to know what some other restorative poses are, [click here](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/finder/browse_categories/restorative).  
Tonight we worked on some restorative hip openers, twists and some other very yummy poses.
