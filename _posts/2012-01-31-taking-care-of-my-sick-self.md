    Me and my sick self snuggly under the warm blankets while watching TV.
  </p>
</div>

  
I am snuggled under blankets in my jammies with some extra heat coming from the heating pad.  
I felt tired and miserable most of the day at work. So unless some miracle happens and I get healthy during the night I will be staying home from work tomorrow.  
Yes, I am going to rest and sleep and watch Lifetime Movie Network all day.  
I am irritated with this cold because I just got over a cold about three weeks ago, which lasted for two weeks AND was over my winter break from work. And I had a plan this week for my exercise schedule.  
Another team member called in sick today and another co-worker had the same tired look in her eyes that I do.  
Just knowing that I don&#8217;t have to get up at 5:30 tomorrow morning already makes me feel a tiny bit better. ðŸ™‚  
I checked out what&#8217;s on TV tomorrow&#8211;it seems to be OK. So hopefully I won&#8217;t be too bored.  
Maybe I will sleep all day and it won&#8217;t matter what is on TV.
