Friday night was my company holiday party.  
I ate a little more than I probably should have. And had 3-4 glasses of wine.  
But man, I danced like crazy. My calves still hurt tonight from all that jumping around, having fun, sweating and being a dancing fool. I love dancing. And it&#8217;s a great work out.  
Because of certain things this past week I only went to yoga twice and no other working out (besides the dancing, of course). I am going out of town this coming weekend (hoping to take in some walks over the weekend). But I am planning on working out at the gym before heading to Phoenix on Friday.
