    I switched between leg presses, biceps and rows today.

Today I debated on if I should do my regular Tuesday exercise routine on the spin bike (and if time permits, weights and abs) or switch it up a bit.  
I decided to try something different. We have three regular ellipticals in the work gym and one &#8220;crazy&#8221; one: it&#8217;s a [Precor Adaptive Motion Trainer](http://www.precor.com/products/en/commercial/cardio/precor-experience-series/830-line/amtr-835-adaptive-motion-trainerr). It&#8217;s like a stepper and an elliptical.  
I did a 45-minute interval workout. When the resistance was low I used the elliptical in its full capacity&#8211;long strides. When the resistance was higher I used it more as a stepper. So every two minutes I was switching it up.  
After my cardio I did some leg presses and arms with the free weights. Then I did some abs with the stability ball.  
(I switch up my spin bike routine as well. If I do the &#8220;classes,&#8221; there are four choices and even within each &#8220;class&#8221; they vary. It&#8217;s important to keep your muscles guessing. Otherwise you can plateau. I also try to change up my weight routine and abs as well.)
