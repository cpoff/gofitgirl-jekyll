So for those of you who don&#8217;t think yoga is a real workout &#8230; I hadn&#8217;t worked out in almost 3 weeks because of the cold I had. I went back to yoga yesterday. And I took it easy. I didn&#8217;t overly push myself.  
Today I am sore! My chest is a little sore and the part where my arm meets my arm pit is sore.  
I tried to figure out what muscle that is but the [charts online](http://www.faqs.org/health/images/uchr_01_img0105.jpg) don&#8217;t specifically point to it and label. Is there such thing as pectoralis minor?  
I took anatomy in college when I thought I wanted to be a nurse but I don&#8217;t remember much. (And yes, I hate blood and needles so what the hell was I thinking?)
