I love taking the 5:30 p.m. Friday yoga class. Sometimes it is difficult to leave work a little after 5 to make it to class on time. Tonight I almost thought I might miss the class. But luckily I didn&#8217;t.  
Suraya, the instructor, is amazing. The class is a great workout and a great way to end a workweek, especially a tough one. I wish my morning yoga class hadn&#8217;t been canceled&#8211;I really liked my balance of yoga and spin. But my workouts have been a lot more spin heavy lately. I am trying to figure out how to balance things out a little better.  
At the end of the Friday evening yoga class I have a feeling of satisfaction of accomplishing something&#8211;both physical and mental. I almost feel refreshed and ready to start my weekend, whether the weekend is fully packed or more easy going, like this upcoming weekend.
