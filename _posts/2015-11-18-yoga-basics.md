    My yoga journal sequence is with me whenever I teach. Every participant of the workshop received a print out of  the sequence we practiced during the workshop.

Over the weekend Curt and I were in his hometown.  
Curt is from a small Missouri town. So small that they don&#8217;t have yoga among other things.  
I held a yoga workshop for members of the community.  
I love finding ways to bring yoga to anyone who wants to experience the practice.  
It was my first workshop, which I called Albany Yoga Basics Workshop.  
I taught the ladies basic yoga poses while also focusing on alignment and our breath. I also taught them some basic Restorative Yoga poses.  
I was able to work on my language and really focus on teaching true beginners, which I feel is my specialty right now as a yoga teacher.  
I really do enjoy teaching.  
This was extra fun as all the women were familiar with each other and many are close friends.  
They laughed and made jokes and enjoyed themselves.  
They all got to take home a copy of the sequence we practiced so they can practice at home or even with each other.  
I plan to try to get inventive and continue to bring yoga to a community that enjoys it and wants it. Stay tuned Albany, Mo.!
