I was optimistic this morning. I knew there was a good chance we would have no yoga teacher for the morning yoga class at my gym. I got up early and went to the 7:15 a.m. yoga class.  
And I was right. No teacher.  
I had to workout and couldn&#8217;t get sweaty (no stuff to shower and get all good and nice smelling with). So I did yoga by Ann. I figured I could do about 30 minutes totally on my own. I ended up doing about 40 minutes. Not too shabby.  
With my a.m. yoga class being temporarily canceled I have to revamp my workout sked. Which is a bummer on many levels.  
Tomorrow night I plan to hit my regular spin class. Then Wednesday I will attend the evening spin class. I will miss class on Thursday because I have a training in the city and then a dinner that evening.  
I have been looking at the classes offered on Mondays and Wednesdays and debating on more spin classes, body conditioning, night yoga class, some sort of ballet class &#8230; They are all in the evening. On Mondays and Wednesdays there is a 6:15 a.m. body conditioning class. I can&#8217;t get up that early and definitely not for cardio.  
So for now my evenings are going to be occupied by gym classes. I really enjoy my mixture of yoga and spin. I hope to have it back soon.
