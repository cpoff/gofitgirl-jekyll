My home address is in Portland. But my community is Beaverton, a suburb of Portland.  
I recently joined a group through the [Beaverton Chamber of Commerce called 100 Strong in Beaverton](https://www.facebook.com/100stronginbeaverton).  
The group is still fairly new.  
The idea of the group is women in business focus on giving back through charity donations and community involvement and while also creating a mentorship program within the group.  
If 1oo women give $100 once a quarter then the group can raise $40,000 a year. Every quarter a different beneficiary receives the $10,000 raised.  
This quarter the funds will go to the [Tualatin Hills Park Foundation Champions Too](http://www.thprd.org/news/news.cfm?id=1603).  
Champions Too is an outdoor field, which will be constructed for athletes (of all ages) with physical or development disabilities.  
According to the [Tualatin Hills Park Foundation website](http://www.thprd.org/news/news.cfm?id=1603), the multipurpose athletic field complex will feature side-by-side synthetic turf fields with lights, an adjoining field made of natural grass, and an overlapping baseball diamond with 90-foot basepaths.  
I love this idea, reaching out to a community that has a need. And the great thing is, everyone can use it.  
I attended a fundraising breakfast on Thursday. Amy Roloff, from [TLC&#8217;s Little People Big World](http://therolofffamily.com), spoke at the event.  
I have watched [Little People Big World](http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/little-people-big-world/) for years. And I was surprised when Amy told me the show was still on. For some reason I thought it had ended.  
I liked her honesty. And really, the Amy you see on TV is the same one you meet in person. She is open, honest, frank and funny.  
The [Amy Roloff Charity Foundation](http://amyroloffcharityfoundation.org/about-the-amy-roloff-charity-foundation/) helps non-profit organizations raise funds for children and youth who face social, emotional, mental and physical challenges.  
She was the perfect speaker for Thursday morning&#8217;s event.  
I&#8217;m really excited to be part of an awesome organization and community working to help others. I also hope to benefit from the mentorship part of it as well as I continue on my quest as a yoga teacher and cycling instructor and continue to grow and expand in that roll.
