I am committed to eating healthy as [I wrote about recently](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9385). But I have to admit I am having a hard time with the accountability.  
Weight Watchers helped me lose my 30 pounds years ago. So I have decided to utilize the expertise of them once again. I don&#8217;t have time to go to meetings (or I guess I am not willing to make the time). I think the support meetings are important. But for now I really need to track my food and receive a little knowledge once again on making better choices.  
When I attended meetings before I attended Weight Watchers at work, which was great. Easy to make meetings and having a lot in common with the other members of the group made me successful.  
Today I signed up for [Weight Watchers online](http://weightwatchers.com). The program has changed since I last tracked my food. So I am taking the time to learn the program and how the points differ from what I knew and practiced for many years.  
Some of you may think I look fine. That I don&#8217;t need to lose weight. But I actually am about 5-6 pounds over my original goal weight. And the farther you get from your goal weight the harder it is to get back to it. So I am taking action now! (Plus some of my pants are too tight&#8211;that&#8217;s always an indicator that I need to lose a few pounds.)  
As I was signing up for WW online the site mentioned: _Tracking, or keeping a record of what and how much you eat, will make you aware what you’re eating—and that will help you make smart decisions_. This is so true. The way I look at it, it is the same as balancing your checkbook. We always seem to think we have more money than we really do.  
Even a little bit of food knowledge can go a long way. Knowing what a portion really is can be a rude awakening. But it is important to know this stuff. It will make me (and you) successful in weight loss and healthy eating.  
You can save favorite foods, recipes and activity (aka exercise) online, which is pretty cool. I tend to eat a lot of the same things. So when I go back to track I can just click through my favorites and add to my online tracker rather easily.  
I will keep you updated on my venture.
