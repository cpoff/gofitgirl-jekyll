    Dear Ann &#8230;
  </p>
</div>

  
At the end of my yoga teacher training we did an exercise in class where we pretended like we were all getting together a year later for a reunion.  
As I type this I realize our reunion would be about now &#8230;  
We talked about what we <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>did</strong></span>. The idea was if we said it as if it did actually happen it would make it more real. We were advised to write a letter to ourselves to read in a year, which I did.  
I wrote to myself on May 9, 2014 with instructions on the envelope that I could open the letter today or later. I opened that letter today.  
I addressed the letter to: Dear Ann&#8211;now a yoga teacher. Check! **DONE**  
I stated intentions in class and in the letter (with some edits) to the following:

  * I quit my job. **DONE**
  * I taught my first yoga class at [Mindful Yoga Studio](http://www.mindfulyogatucson.com) in Tucson (my hometown) on Sunday, June 29, 2014 as a donation class. **DONE**
  * I started subbing yoga classes at the gym. **DONE** (And extra **DONE** with taking over three classes a week for three months while the regular yoga teacher was on maternity leave.)
  * I started teaching my own classes a few times a week. **DONE** (I&#8217;m teaching four regular yoga classes a week with lots of subbing. And two new regular classes starting next month. I am also teaching five regular cycling classes.)
  * I work the front desk at a yoga studio once a week to learn the business (and make a little money). Will be **DONE** starting June or July. I&#8217;ve already been hired (date to start to be determined) at a yoga studio once a week working the front desk along with two regular yoga classes.
  * I teach numerous 1:1s (private sessions). _Working on this._
  * I started working with an organization (name withheld) on a yoga program for their clients. _We moved and I wasn&#8217;t able to start the program I wanted. But I&#8217;m looking into where my [Karma Yoga](http://www.yogajournal.com/article/philosophy/do-yoga-do-good/) will take me here in Portland. _
  * I taught a weekend yoga workshop in Albany, Mo. (Curt&#8217;s hometown) to a community who has very little access to yoga. _Hasn&#8217;t happened yet. But I would love to do this sometime. _
  * Really got to focus more energy, time and commitment to GFG! **DONE**
  * We got a dog. _We&#8217;re talking about getting a dog now that we have moved and my schedule is fairly flexible. I am just not sure I am ready for the commitment to walking a dog regularly just quite yet. _

When I wrote the post about my [BIG decision](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/09/big/) to quit my corporate job in September I mentioned that part of my &#8220;fantasy&#8221; was to quit my job, which is on the top of the list with a nice big **DONE**.  
I also wrote: Wow, a year later and my life has changed so much.  
That made me chuckle. Because now looking back at a year ago when my fellow yoga teachers in training and I had our &#8220;reunion&#8221; we were almost finished with our teacher training and had learned so much in the 10 months.  
And I look at my life now and yes, wow, a year later and my life has changed so much.  
My letter to myself said &#8230; I truly plan to take my teacher training on to a new step in my life. I think we can all agree that that definitely happened and continues.  
I miss my friends in the Bay Area terribly. But it was a good decision for Curt and me to move to Portland for a variety of reasons.  
We both quit our jobs at the end of last year. We moved to Portland at the beginning of this year&#8211;now about four months in. We are both working to reinvent ourselves. Me with my teaching. Curt with taking classes at Portland Code School where he is learning a new skill. We have basically started over. And so far we are both happy with the direction things are going.  
I really do enjoy teaching both indoor cycling and yoga classes. I love being near dear Oregon friends. I like meeting new people and making new friends and colleagues.  
The stress in my life is minimal right now and that feels so good.  
Life&#8217;s too short to not be happy. We all deserve to be happy.  
As I was putting the finishing touches on this post I decided to write myself another letter today and open it in a year and see how much has changed.
