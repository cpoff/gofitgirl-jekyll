So yesterday I get dressed for the gym. I go to my purse to grab my iPod. I can&#8217;t find it. I freak for a second and then remember where it is. It isn&#8217;t lost. But it isn&#8217;t with me either.  
I had no music while on the ellipitical yesterday. That 30 minutes felt a lot longer than 30 minutes. At least I had my trashy celebrity news to read.  
But music definitely makes the workout seem a lot easier. I burned fewer calories and didn&#8217;t go as fast or as far as I usually do with my tunes.
