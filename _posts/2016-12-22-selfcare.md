<a href="http://gofitgirl.com/2016/12/selfcare/reflective_self-care-sequence-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-15381"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-15381" src="http://gofitgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Reflective_self-care-sequence-2-212x300.jpg" alt="reflective_self-care-sequence-2" width="212" height="300" /></a>My theme over the past week was about being reflective and showing self-care.  
The sequence was more about being in the pose than getting into it. Reminding ourselves of peace, love, compassion, kindness and acceptance for ourselves.  
I was really excited to teach this and share it.  
But then Snowpocalypse part deux happened in Portland. My classes from Wednesday evening through Saturday were canceled.  
This sequence was basically my Christmas (or whatever you celebrate or don&#8217;t) gift to my students.  
So many didn&#8217;t get to practice the sequence with me. Those who did seemed to enjoy it and I received some good feedback.  
So, I decided to whip up (well, work diligently&#8211;I&#8217;m no artist) some stick figures of the sequence for my students and readers and friends to use and enjoy.  
If you would like me to e-mail you a full-sized PDF, send me an e-mail at ann@gofitgirl.com and I will send one your way.  
If you&#8217;re one of my regular Portland-area students I will have some copies of the sequence with me.  
As we move through the holidays, the end of the year and the new year, please take time for yourself. You can&#8217;t take care of anyone else unless you take care of yourself.  
That might mean taking a yoga class, curling up with a good book, taking a bath, watching a movie, getting a massage, having a private yoga session/class &#8230; my rates are going up in January. If you want lower rates, reserve them now before 2016 is over. Contact me at ann@gofitgirl.com for rates.  
Whatever you do or don&#8217;t do (remember sometimes the best thing for you is to say no) just remember to take care of you.
