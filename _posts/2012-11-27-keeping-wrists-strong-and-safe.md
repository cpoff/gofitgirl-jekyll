    Keeping my wrist straight (with no bend) while riding the stationary spin bike.
  </p>
</div>

  
Recently in spin class Jenn has been encouraging us to make sure we are keeping our wrists safe.  
It feels really weird and I initially resisted the correct alignment.  
But the past fews classes I have been working on having my wrists in the proper alignment. It is not comfortable, but I am starting to get slightly used to it.  
[This site shows](http://trainingwithmatt.com/archives/1189) correct and incorrect hand, arm and wrist positioning while in a spin class or out on a bike on the road.

<div title="Page 2">
  My focus is to not have a bend in the wrist, which sounds easier than it actually is.<br /> Even though I am not positioning my wrists correctly throughout the whole class I am aware of what I need to do.<br /> And the little bit more I do each time is strengthening my muscles and will make it like second nature soon.<br /> I have tendonitis in my right wrist from working at Baskin Robbins when I was 15. I know that seems crazy. But the way you repeatedly scoop ice cream is not good for the wrist.<br /> I have pretty thin and tiny wrists and need to be careful with them, whether it is with the position on the spin bike or when in certain yoga poses, especially in <a href="http://img4-3.cookinglight.timeinc.net/i/2008/12/0812p66-side-plank-l.jpg?400:400">side plank</a>.<br /> According to theÂ <a href="http://spinning.com">spinning.com site</a>, this is what you need to think about when your riding a spin bike and your wrists:</p> 
  
  <div title="Page 2">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Check alignment of wrist and hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the wrist excessively flexed for long periods?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are the handlebars too low?
      </li>
      <li>
        Demonstrate neutral alignment of wrist.
      </li>
    </ul>
