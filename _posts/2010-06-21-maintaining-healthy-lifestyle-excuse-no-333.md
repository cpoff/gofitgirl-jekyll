Usually when we have guests in town there is a lot of eating out. We have some amazing restaurants around here. And I also usually don&#8217;t hit the gym as consistently as when no one is in town.  
This past week was a little better. I only missed the gym once: yoga on Friday night. Saturday I did 1 1/2 hours at the gym instead of the normal two. So not too shabby.  
But the eating and drinking was out of control. I do have to say I had some delicious food over the past few days.  
So today I am back at it.
