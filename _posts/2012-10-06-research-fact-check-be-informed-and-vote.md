I am a non-party Liberal. When I first registered to vote at 18 in Tucson, Ariz. I registered Democrat.  
Once I become a journalist I changed my party affiliation. I decided to stay non-party once I left the journalism world. I identify more as a Liberal than as a Democrat. I vote Democratic because really in America there is only a two party system. And the Democratic beliefs are the closest to my mine.  
As a Liberal some of the things I believe in are gay rights; women&#8217;s rights, affordable (or free) healthcare for all, immigration programs, paying taxes, helping others in need, Separation of Church and State, religious rights and I am pro-choice.  
Today marks one month from the General Election. So I thought it would be a good day to post this. (I actually put the thoughts down on paper for this post months ago. I carry a notebook around for Go Fit Girl! ideas and posts. And it is filled with lots of good stuff.)  
During the last California election I was chatting with two other co-workers (one in her 20s, the other in her 30s). We are all either Democrats or Liberals. And NONE of us voted. I looked at them and said, We are the reason Republicans keep winning. They agreed.  
Why aren&#8217;t people my age and younger voting? Why don&#8217;t we care enough?  
I personally have issues with the [Electoral College](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/about.html). I believe every single vote should count. In California, a lot of times your vote doesn&#8217;t matter. In the last Presidential Election as soon as the polls closed the state on the map turned blue for Obama. But then something like [Proposition 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8), every vote did count. Unfortunately the votes didn&#8217;t add up in favor of gay rights.  
So regardless we should vote. People in other countries are dying for the right to vote. And with vote by mail as an option there really is no excuse.  
Despite all the terrible things that have happened in my home state I am proud of where I am from. A lot of the ugliness in the state comes from uninformed and ignorant politicians who are not Arizona (or Tucson) natives.  
Why does money/power make people so ugly?  
Not everyone grew up with money. Not everyone grew up with opportunity. Some struggled and worked very hard to get where they are. If you were born into money you can&#8217;t be faulted for that. But you have the power to make a difference. Don&#8217;t throw that opportunity out the window.  
For many Americans every single day is about survival. Will I have enough money to buy groceries? Pay the rent? Buy school uniforms? Pay my phone bill? Electric bill? There are so many people working multiple jobs and they still aren&#8217;t making ends meet.  
Sometimes a person just needs to catch a break.  
OK, here is my rant &#8230; Why are we going back in time with women&#8217;s rights?  
Why are we back 50+ years? We are in a time where male politicians are claiming women are whores for taking birth control to prevent pregnancy (THE NERVE OF US!!!) or claiming legitimate rape won&#8217;t result in pregnancy (Yea, because that 13-year-old raped by her stepfather must have really wanted a baby) or denying poor women or any woman healthcare to prevent cancer, STDs and other issues just because they aren&#8217;t pro-choice.  
If you are anti-abortion then why aren&#8217;t you supporting [Planned Parenthood](http://www.plannedparenthood.org)? PP&#8217;s main goal is to educate women and girls and provide health care. Women and girls need to know how to take care and protect themselves.  
I&#8217;m gonna say it: My vagina is none of your business! Why do so many male politicians feel it is their right to tell me that I can&#8217;t use birth control? I am almost 38 years old. I know what is best for my body and my family. Yup, I said family. My family is Curt and me (and until about 10 months ago included my furbaby, Joey).  
My husband and I are I Child Free by Choice. I find it to be a very personal choice whether or not to have children.  
And my life matters. And I find it very fulfilling.We love to travel and see the world.  
I am a daughter, sister, wife, granddaughter, cousin, friend, auntie, blogger and someone who loves the fact that she works for a company who strives to help patients with cancer.  
I believe in religious rights for all, not just Christians. I believe in true Separation of Church and State.  
Please do your research. Be informed. Fact check! And don&#8217;t believe everything that comes out of politicians mouths. If someone can&#8217;t be honest about their marathon time how can we trust them with the important issues.  
You may not agree with me. And that&#8217;s OK. I just ask that you make sure you are as informed as you can be on Nov. 6.  
We should  be angry and demand more. The least we can do is vote. So on Nov. 6 go out and vote. Don&#8217;t make excuses. Just do it. Lucky for me I can vote in my  jammies at home as I opt for vote by mail.
