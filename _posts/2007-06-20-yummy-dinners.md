So I have never enjoyed cooking or have been a really good cook. I can follow a recipe as long as it is simple and doesn&#8217;t have a ton of ingredients (or things I have never heard of).  
Now I love pasta. Love it! When I first started WW I pretty much steered clear of it. But I have found ways to eat it fairly often. I have started eating the whole wheat pasta. I can eat more pasta with the whole wheat. Yum! I usually have about a cup and a half&#8211;it really is plenty.  
A couple of weeks ago I decided to make penne pasta for Curt and myself. I sauteed garlic in olive oil along with brocolli and mushrooms. Then put a little extra olive oil on the pasta and added the veggies. So good and so filling. I get my oils in and veggies.  
Last night I sauteed garlic with olive oil and added tomatoes. Man, that was REALLY good. The pasta was wheat spaghetti. 1 tsp. of olive oil on the pasta and toss in the sauteed tomatoes.  
I also usually have a salad with my dinner and use [Wish Bone&#8217;s Salad Spritzers](http://www.wish-bone.com/dressing.asp?kind=ss&dressing=ss_balsa). I have tried the Red Wine Spritzer, Italian Vinaigrette and the Caesar. All good. And I keep one at work for my salads. If you don&#8217;t like your salad doused with dressing you should check these out. Great invention!
