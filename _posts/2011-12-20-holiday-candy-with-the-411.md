This time of the year there is really just so much crap: goodies, lunches, dinners, parties, booze. It&#8217;s so difficult to not be tempted.  
I have a candy bowl at my desk. The holiday items are mini candy canes and candy cane Hershey kisses. I&#8217;m not a huge candy cane fan. But those special kisses are another story.  
I decided to do a little research on the treats. One mini candy cane is 12 calories and no grams of fat. And if I remember correctly, peppermint is supposed to curb hunger.  
One of the kisses is about 18 calories and 1.3 grams of fat. But really, who is gonna eat one?  
The bag indicates that 9 pieces is a serving, which comes to 220 calories and 12 grams of fat.  
It&#8217;s probably too late to tell you to be careful this holiday season. But you can still get that exercise in. I am trying to keep that consistent. So far not bad.
