    Here I am at a &#8220;vegetarian&#8221; Mexican restaurant called La Buena Tierra. The information we read on the restaurant claimed it was vegetarian. But Curt had fish and I had chicken. Does vegetarian in Mexico City mean no red meat?

Right before Curt and I headed to Mexico City I weighed in super close to my goal weight. Like ounces away.  
My hard work is paying off.  
[Like I said I would](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9612), while in Mexico City I ate and drank what I wanted. I had a lot of amazing food and beer and margaritas.  
We did a lot of walking. So that usually helps when on vacation to keep the weight gain minimal.  
And it was minimal. I am just a pound away from my goal weight. Easy peasy!  
We flew back Saturday evening. Sunday morning I was attending my regular Vinyasa yoga class with Ashley.  
And today I got back on plan and am tracking my food again.  
And I also went to my now regular evening body conditioning class at the gym, while meeting up with my friend Monica.  
While in Mexico I was careful with what I ate and drank. I avoided most fresh fruits and vegetables. I always drank bottled water. I used bottled water even when I brushed my teeth.  
It was a bummer to avoid fresh fruits and veggies. But I had to be careful. And that paid off. I didn&#8217;t get sick.
