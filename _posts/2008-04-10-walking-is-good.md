So today my good friend and co-worker Mia asked me if I wanted to go for a walk.  
We were gone about an hour, had a great walk, got to be outside (it was beautiful) and catch up. Then we stopped at a little market and got lunch. I got a yummy pastrami sandwich. Mia got a salad and a good looking piece of salmon.  
We have decided we need to make this a habit. Getting out of the office and getting some fresh air was good for both of us.
