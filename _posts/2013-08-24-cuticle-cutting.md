A classmate recently opened a nail salon and day spa in my hometown, Tucson.  
Christina, the owner of [greentoes](http://www.greentoestucson.com), recently posted an article on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/greentoes.tucson) she came upon titled [To Cut Cuticles or Not?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/cuticle-cutting-manicure-safety_n_1587791.html)  
I regulary get manicures and pedicures.  
And I have my cuticles cut. It&#8217;s a double-edged sword. I get them cut because they look like crap if I don&#8217;t. And they look like crap soon after my mani-pedi because I get them cut.  
I have heard that you really shouldn&#8217;t have your cuticles cut because they get raggedy. Pushing them back is OK, but you shouldn&#8217;t cut them.  
What I didn&#8217;t realize was that having your cuticles cut can also be a health issue.  
From the article: &#8220;Trimming the cuticles can break the seal that protects the surrounding skin from infection,&#8221; Dr. Eric Schweiger said.  
Another doctor, Dr. Michael Gold, quoted in the article said: &#8220;the main concern with trimming your cuticles is getting an infection from instruments that are not cleaned and sterilized properly. One needs to understand that cuticles play a very important role in preventing things like bacteria from entering the area at the base of the nail.&#8221;  
The only real benefit to having your cuticles cut is cosmetic. I still do it even though I know it will look terrible in a couple of days and I will be trimming them myself even before I head back to the salon.  
Maybe I should try to go with the push-back method for some time and see how that works out.
