So I had every intention to go to my 7:15 a.m. yoga class this morning. I had my gym bag packed with my work clothes and had my yoga clothes layed out and ready to jump into when my alarm went off at 6:15. When it went off I thought, there is no way I can or am gonna get up.  
I didn&#8217;t sleep well last night. I go through these cycles where I sleep really well for some time and then don&#8217;t for some time. I think I am in the don&#8217;t cycle. I am still really tired.  
Today at work we have a lunch function called Mix n Mingle. The idea is for you to get to know each other&#8211;especially the new people. We are a fast-growing (still small) company so it is hard to know everyone. Because of the lunch no lunchtime workout.  
But I am thinking maybe an afternoon 1/2 hour walk may do the trick.  
My workout schedule is all off from being out of town over the weekend. And Curt&#8217;s friend Ryan is coming into town on Thursday. So I have three evenings to get the house in order (luckily it is in pretty good shape) and get groceries and all that fun stuff.
