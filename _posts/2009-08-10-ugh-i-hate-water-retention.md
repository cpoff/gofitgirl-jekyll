As you know Mondays are my weigh-in day.  
I made sure yesterday that I drank a ton of water. As I was feeling the water retention. My fingers were fat!  
But, unfortunately, water retention remained and altered the numbers on the scale. So I couldn&#8217;t get an accurate reading of my weight.  
I wasn&#8217;t super great with the food last week. But I wasn&#8217;t horrible either. So I figured the number would either be the same or just a little lower. Oh well. There&#8217;s always next week.
