    My plan was to do this 35-minute workout today, which is supposed to include tips and tunes. I am not sure if that is true since I didn't do it.
  </p>
</div>

  
Because it is Christmas both the gym and yoga studio were closed today.  
If the yoga studio had been opened I probably would have taken a yoga class today as there wouldn&#8217;t be any classes at the gym and it is rather difficult for me to get that motivated.  
I had debated if I should go for a walk or try running. I hate running and I suck at it.  
Then the other day in the mail I received a mini package in the mail from an old gym friend.  
So my plan was that sometime this morning I would embark on the Holiday Workout, which claims to have holiday tunes and some tips.  
The Holiday Workout never happened. Instead today there was lots of lounging, movie watching, a little knitting, a few naps. And you can&#8217;t forget about the eating and drinking.  
Since I get up at 5 during the week for work my sleeping in on the weekends is normally around 6:30. Which is what time I got up today.  
I got up and made a white chocolate mocha drink, grabbed a Mexican pastry and plopped myself on the couch under a blanket. I watched some Christmas movies, napped, talked to the in-laws.  
After Curt got up we had coffee, then a chat with my dad and then tamales.  
After tamales I called my mom&#8217;s house and talked to five different family members, of course, including my mom. Then more movie watching and napping and more movie watching.

    My first attempt at flat enchiladas was successful.

For our Christmas dinner I made I made flat enchiladas. This was the first time I made them. They came out rather good.  
Curt had never had flat enchiladas before. And he liked them so I am calling them a success. (I liked them, too.)  
I baked them in the oven instead of frying them, which made them a lot healthier. Though how healthy can masa with lard and cheese be?  
Thanks to my Mom and Google for advice for my Christmas meal.  
The lazy and lounging are continuing this evening. I feel like I might be coming down with a cold (I really hope not) so I am trying to take it easy.  
Merry Christmas everyone!
