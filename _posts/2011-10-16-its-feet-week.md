The theme for this week &#8230; is feet!  
I personally think feet are one of the ugliest parts of our bodies. I would say I have a foot unfettish. My feet are super ticklish. So I hate having them touched.  
Probably about six years ago I decided to treat myself to a mani/pedi. I had never had a pedicure before.  
I am now a regular of both the mani and the pedi. But I still go nuts when they do the foot scrubbie thing. Eeek.

    My REI gift card and moola went to these items: new yoga mat, yoga block and tank top.

I have a point here &#8230;  
So many of us abuse our feet. We wear bad, unsafe, uncomfortable shoes. We stand for too long with bad or good shoes. We don&#8217;t wear the right shoes when we exercise. We don&#8217;t realize the care we really need to give our feet, which I think includes pedicures and massages.  
Our feet have so many [pressures points](http://images.thriftyfun.com/images/database/tff21419311.jpg) that link to other parts of the body. It is truly amazing how much our feet can affect our health and wellness.
