I worked from home today, which worked out pretty well. I got a lot of work done and was able to &#8220;sleep in&#8221; until 6:30. I have been getting up at 5 a.m. for work these days.  
I was able to take the 5 p.m. [Forrest Yoga](http://www.forrestyoga.com/page.cfm?name=philosophy) class. I am really getting into this type of yoga. It is intense and amazing and spiritual and sweaty and cleansing and really works the abs and has you hold poses and works on your breathing.  
Today before class started we sang. We sang a song from [Chenoa Egawa](http://www.forrestyogastore.com/Ana-Forrest-Yoga-cp/CHENOA/MUS/Chenoa+Egawa+%3Ci%3E%22Spirit+of+Salishan%22). I couldn&#8217;t find the exact song. But listen to a few of the samples and you will get the idea. The instructor had mentioned that if you were in some kind of not good or happy or positive mood this song would change it immediately. It was fun.  
I felt truly amazing after class. The feelings and sensations are hard to describe.
