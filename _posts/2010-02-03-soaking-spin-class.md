Since yoga has been temporarily (I keep using that word) been canceled until a new teacher is found I have to do some other sort of work out on Mondays and Wednesdays.  
Tonight I went to spin. Miwa, who teaches Thursday nights, subbed tonight. Not sure who actually teaches Wednesday nights. (Some of the classes and teachers have been a little out of sorts lately.) Miwa is spunky and teaches a good hard class.  
Tonight she had us imagine that we had one of those kid carts things attached to the back of our bike. Every minute we would add a &#8220;kid&#8221; to the cart. Miwa&#8217;s classes are really tough, but she makes them fun.  
At the end of class I was absolutely soaked.  
I am missing spin tomorrow because I have a training in the city (and a dinner afterward). I won&#8217;t be back in time for class.
