    What do you do with your hands and arms when you hula hoop?

One of the challenges in [Go Fit Girl&#8217;s April Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=10354) is to rock that hula hoop.  
According to this [article on Healthy.com](http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20397949,00.html), we are all as cool as the First Lady. And we know how cool Michelle Obama is. And I can guarantee she can rock that hoop.  
The article also says, doing any combination of hula-hoop moves for 30 minutes will have you burn 150 to 250 calories.  
I am pretty good with the hula hoop. I haven&#8217;t maxed out on time yet&#8211;I usually stop myself even though I know I could keep on going. But after just five minutes I can definitely feel it in my abs, but especially in my obliques.  
The Health.com article also gives tips on how to hula hoop. I think the advice is pretty good.  
Here are tips on the Forward Stance: Stand inside the hoop with your right foot (or left foot&#8211;whatever feels comfortable) forward, holding the hoop against your lower back. Keeping your pelvis tucked, shoulders squared, and chest lifted, bend your knees slightly and give the hoop a good counterclockwise spin around your waist, making sure it’s level. To keep the hoop moving, shift your weight quickly between your front and back legs, moving your hips backward (A) and forward (B).  
I do the Side Stance: Stand with your feet a bit wider than shoulder-width apart and parallel to each other. Give the hoop a good spin, and rock your hips from side to side so the hoop hits on the sides of your waist. Make sure your abs are tight, with chest and head lifted. The more power you put into each push, the faster the hoop will go.  
And I realize that I always go counter-clockwise. I tried to spin that hoop in the other direction and failed.  
[Livestrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/25452-hula-hoops-good-exercise/) refers to our old school hula hooping as a back to basics exercise &#8230; and a return to childhood. The article also says, if you can maintain the hooping activity for at least 20 minutes, it is a viable form of aerobic exercise. And apparently can alleviate some symptoms of arthritis. Hula-hoop exercise can also be used to enhance agility, coordination and athleticism.  
And the Livestrong article also says, over time, you will become proficient at hooping. Which means all of you struggling with the hoop, keep working it. Eventually you will get it and get better. Just keep working those hips &#8230; And I can say that some of the Challengers have definitely done that. I know for sure one person who could only spin it around a few times is now up to 12 minutes.  
And if you just can&#8217;t get that hoop around you might want to [watch this little guy&#8217;s style](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPJQME400TE) with those hips.
