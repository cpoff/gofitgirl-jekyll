Also called a side stitch or side cramp, etc.  
According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_stitch) a side pain/stitch is an intense stabbing pain that occurs during exercise.  
[WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/how-to-stop-runners-cramps) talks about how to avoid side pains, and if they do occur how to get rid of them. Apparently they occur during exercise and are a &#8220;result of shallow breathing, not breathing deeply from the lower lung.&#8221;  
I got one tonight during spin. I know that to make it go away you should breath deeply and slowly. I did and eventually it went away.  
What I am reading is that side pains usually happen to beginners. Hmmm, I still get them sometimes and I have been exercising pretty regularly for almost three years.  
I wonder if my [exercise-induced asthma](http://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/exercise-induced-asthma) is a contributor? Well, the WebMD article I linked to doesn&#8217;t mention that.
