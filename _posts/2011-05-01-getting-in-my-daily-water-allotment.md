My friend Erica was recently told by her midwife that it was recommended that Erica drink 100 ounces of water a day. That is about 13 8 oz. servings of water. That&#8217;s a lot of water.  
For today&#8217;s post I decided to track how much water I have consumed today. I am on my 12th 8 oz. serving for the day and it isn&#8217;t even 7 p.m.  
I recently had a doctor&#8217;s visit and my doctor and I did discuss water intake. At the time the water bottle I was using regularly was a 20 oz. bottle. (Photo on the right.) My doctor told me three bottles a day was what I should at least be drinking. Anything over that was great, but not necessary.  
I used to struggle with getting enough water in me every day. Now it seems so easy. Here are my tricks. First, I switched to a different kind of water bottle. I call my [Camelbak water bottle my adult sippy cup](http://www.rei.com/product/776890/camelbak-better-bottle-16-fl-oz). It seems to make me drink more water and it makes it easier. I don&#8217;t feel like it is a chore to drink water. I drink water on the way to work and the way back. (16 oz. each way&#8211;4 servings) When my company moved we did away with plastic water bottles. Every employee received an acrylic cup with straw, [which look kinda like this](http://www.usimprints.com/store/promotional-mugs-custom-drinkware/product/victory-5-working-days-16-oz-durable-acrylic-double-wall-insulated-tumbler-with-lid-and-straw/).

In a normal day I will drink my 16 0z. on the way to work; 32 oz. while at work; 16 oz. on the way home; and 16 more oz. that evening with dinner. That&#8217;s 80 oz. That&#8217;s pretty great, eh?  
I hardly drink soda anymore. I was only drinking diet&#8211;or Coke Zero. But I know that isn&#8217;t great for anyone either. I still drink and enjoy my coffee just about every day. My morning ritual at work once I arrive is to make my cup of coffee and fill up my acrylic cup with room temp water.  
So, Erica, I will likely consume at least 100 ounces of water today. Maybe even more. What is working for you to drink that much water?
