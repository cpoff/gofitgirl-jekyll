&#8230; Penny.  
Thanks to Penny, Alicia and Lauren for participating in last week&#8217;s Comment Contest Tuesday on a Wednesday.  
I mentioned inÂ [that post](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=7317) that we were only going to have green beans as our healthy option for Thanksgiving dinner. We also ended up having salad. Wooo! What a way to balance that meal, eh?  
Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving and weekend.  
As the Christmas season gears up remember to take a step back, take a breath and try not to stress yourself out. Decide if it is worth it or not. It likely is &#8230; not.  
Good luck.
