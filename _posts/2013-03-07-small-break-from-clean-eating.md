    This photo is a reenactment of the wine and cheese and other amazing things that I enjoyed last night.

When one tries to maintain a healthy lifestyle there are always bumps in the road.  
Last night one of our law firms took my boss who is about to retire (have I mentioned that yet? That&#8217;s one of the BIG changes going on at work and in my life. He has been my boss for almost eight years) and our team out to dinner.  
I looked at the menu ahead of time online. I do this often to find something to pick out and be ready to order when the time comes. This helps to already have a decision made and not be swayed by other items or even the specials or what others may be ordering. My mind is made up.  
But the menu didn&#8217;t have a lot of plates and was more of an hors d&#8217;oeuvres kind of place.  
So what I decided last night as I was looking at the amazing cheese and meat plates and ham hock sliders and empanadas and the delicious wine that was being poured that I would just go with it.  
Eat the cheese, drink the wine, dabble in the desserts. And get back to healthy eating today, which is what I did (for the most part).  
One of my friends/co-workers last night said: We can eat clean tomorrow. I asked two co-workers today: Are we eating clean?
