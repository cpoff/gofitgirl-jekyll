    This month&#8217;s challenge is about YOU!

This month&#8217;s Go Fit Girl!&#8217;s February Monthly Challenge is about the No. 1 person in your life.  
It&#8217;s not your spouse, partner, kids, parents, boss. It&#8217;s YOU.  
In honor of this month&#8217;s [Love of Reading Month](http://downtowntucson.tucsonnewsnow.com/news/community-spirit/97353-february-love-reading-month) and that other silly celebration that happens in the middle of this month the Monthly Challenge is about focusing on No. 1.  
You have to love yourself and take care of yourself before you can love or take care of anyone else.  
You have to decide what is best for you.  
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important for you and all of those you have in your life. You can&#8217;t take care of anyone else if you aren&#8217;t taking care of No. 1.  
**Nutrition:** It is important to eat healthy regularly, drink lots of water, minimize the soda intake (including diet) along with limiting the alcohol intake as well. Make that your focus for this month with the nutrition challenge. But you are also the best judge of when you need to indulge: eat some chocolate, have two glasses of wine &#8230; You can also judge when you need to eat more vegetables or have a piece of fruit instead of another cup of coffee or a bag of chips.  
**Exercise:** It is important to regularly exercise as well. You and your body are the judge if you need to make sure to get to the gym or yoga studio or take a walk. There are many evenings I am tired and the last thing I want to do is hit the gym or yoga studio. And sometimes I just go home. But 90% of the time I force myself to go and I NEVER regret it, especially a yoga practice. Restorative yoga is a great way to treat yourself.  
You are in charge of what you eat and what you drink and when you exercise or don&#8217;t. But this month, really think about what you are eating before you put it in your mouth. And don&#8217;t forget to get that exercise in.  
Sometimes after a hard or bad or long day I just want to come home and have a drink. Then I think about how I maybe should to try &#8220;earn&#8221; that drink with some exercise. As I said before, I never regret it and feel better afterward.  
This month make sure you take care of you.
