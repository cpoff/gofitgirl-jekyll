It had been a whole week since I had been to spin. And today it was hot. The class went well. I don&#8217;t think Jennifer pushed us as hard because it was so warm. (Most places don&#8217;t have AC here, including the spin room. Apparently they are working on it.)  
This past week my workout sked was a little off. I had two days of training&#8211;so I did my best day to make up for that. Thursday I had planned to go for a walk during my work day &#8230; never happened. I had plans after work so I wasn&#8217;t able to go to my regular spin class.  
I didn&#8217;t take my regular afternoon nap today. After the gym I had to run errands and get some stuff done. My grandpa is in town and he and my dad came over for dinner. Actually when I got home from the pharmacy and cleaners they were already here.  
We had a nice visit, which included early dinner and drinks. Then we were home about 7:30 and I took a nap (our house was pretty warm, too). At this rate I think bed is in order soon.
