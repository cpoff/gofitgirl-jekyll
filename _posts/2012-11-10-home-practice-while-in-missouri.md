I am in Missouri this weekend visiting my in-laws.  
Being married to a hunter makes it an annual tradition to come out for the opening of deer season. My brother-in-law and his sons are here for the weekend as well.  
I brought my [travel yoga mat](http://www.amazon.com/Manduka-Superlite-Folding-Travel-Brilliant/dp/B0090K281U/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1352584061&sr=8-7&keywords=manduka+travel+yoga+mat) with me in the hopes of practicing a few times.  
Marilyn, my mother-in-law, asked if we could practice yoga together today.  
I was happy to oblige.  
The two of us took a break from the hustle and bustle of the house and went down to the basement with our yoga mats, some of my yoga music and a few ideas I had.  
We were probably down there an hour. We worked on [stretching out our lower backs](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/yogacards1.jpg), a little balancing and some stretching. Before getting into [savasana](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/482), we stretched out in [banana](http://www.yinyoga.com/ys2_2.0_asanas_bananasana.php), which is a great stretching pose.  
It was a great home practice for the both of us. I taught Marilyn a few things and I got to have a buddy while practicing.  
I look forward to another practice or two with Marilyn this weekend.
