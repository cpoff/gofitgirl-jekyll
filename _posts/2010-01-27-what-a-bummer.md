My morning yoga classes recently got a new teacher, new to the class but not the gym. The class was bummed when Sarah left after a year.  
We got James at the beginning of the year/month. James is definitely more difficult and pushes more. I was really starting to get into his class and enjoy his style.  
Then today after we completed our practice James told us that it was his last morning class. Wha? He didn&#8217;t know who would be teaching. The early morning class just wasn&#8217;t working in his schedule.  
I plan on showing up to class on Monday. Let&#8217;s hope a yoga instructor does, too.
