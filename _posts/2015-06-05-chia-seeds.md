I was perusing Twitter recently and came upon a recipe from [SELF magazine called Make Ahead Chia Pudding Breakfast](http://www.self.com/food/2015/03/make-ahead-chia-breakfast-obsessed?short_code=2yr2v).  
It was a simple recipe to follow. So I decided to try it.  
I mixed the almond milk, chia seeds, honey and vanilla extract. I let it sit in the fridge overnight.  
I ate half of the recipe along with some blueberries and blackberries atop as a snack between teaching cycle and heading off to teach a yoga class.  
I&#8217;ve written about the benefits of [chia seeds before](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/07/chia/).  
I decided to do some more exploring about these edible seeds, which come from the desert plant _Salvia hispanica._  
According to [Authority Nutrition](http://authoritynutrition.com/11-proven-health-benefits-of-chia-seeds/), chia seeds:

  * Deliver a massive amount of nutrients with very few calories
  * Are loaded with antioxidants
  * Almost all the carbohydrates in them are fiber
  * Are high in quality protein
  * Should be able to help you lose weight (but there is not enough information to prove this), because of the high fiber and protein content, the seeds
  * Are high in Omega-3 fatty acids
  * May improve certain blood markers, which should lower the risk of heart disease and type 2 Diabetes
  * Are high in many important bone nutrients
  * Can cause major improvements in type 2 Diabetes
  * Can improve exercise performance as much as a sports drink
  * Are easy to incorporate into your diet

The recipe calls for 2 ounces of chia seeds and one cup of almond milk. I ate half the recipe for a snack. I made it a second time and doubled the recipe.  
According to Authority Nutrition, a 1 ounce serving of chia seeds contains:

  * **Fiber:** 11 grams.
  * **Protein:** 4 grams.
  * **Fat:** 9 grams (5 of which are Omega-3s).
  * **Calcium:** 18% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDA).
  * **Manganese:** 30% of the RDA.
  * **Magnesium:** 30% of the RDA.
  * **Phosphorus:** 27% of the RDA.
  * They also contain a decent amount of Zinc, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), Potassium, Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) and Vitamin B2.

The recipe was super simple to make. And it was pretty tasty and filling. After teaching cycle class I usually need something to eat with a little substance. The snack held me over while I taught yoga and until I was able to get home and make a late lunch.  
I have had this snack a few times in between teaching one class when I didn&#8217;t have time to eat a whole meal before teaching another.  
Fresh berries make it even better. And it&#8217;s one, two, three, four ingredients to mix together and then toss in the fridge overnight. This could even be breakfast instead of a snack.
