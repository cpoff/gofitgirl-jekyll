**Guest Post: Jen**  
 ****I have to admit, even though I try to eat as healthfully as possible, I eat fast food on a pretty regular basis. Honestly, I simply like things that taste good — and I don&#8217;t like spending a lot of time on prep or cooking.  
But I have to say I was surprised to read the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/mar/03/weight-watchers-mcdonalds-obesity" target="_blank">news</a> that Mickey-D&#8217;s was teaming up with Weight Watchers to rebrand some McDonald&#8217;s fried classics as &#8220;healthy.&#8221;  
True, you can get a handful of items at McDonald&#8217;s for only a handful of Weight Watchers points (each). But even in the world of fast food, there are better, lower-in-fat, lower-calorie options out there.  
Go Fit Girl! had a <a href="http://gofitgirl.com/?p=4843" target="_blank">great guest blog</a> a while back on the importance of researching your fast food. The McD/WW partnership inspired me to revisit that, AND make a little chart of my faves — plus some homemade stuff that&#8217;s as fast and yummy as making a fast-food run.  
Here&#8217;s my list, based on the three popular McD&#8217;s items that have been reported for the [Weight Watchers](http://www.weightwatchers.com/index.aspx) list.

      <strong>Chicken Nuggets</strong>
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top">
      <strong>McDonald&#8217;s McNuggets </strong>(6 piece)<br /> <span class="SmallText">280cal, 18g fat, 13g protein, 540mg sodium*,<br /> 7 WWpts**. Buffalo dipping sauce (the lowest cal sauce they offer):<br /> 35cal, 3g fat, 540mg sodium, 2 WWpts.</span>
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top">
      <strong>Jack in the Box Grilled Chicken<br /> Strips</strong> (4 piece)&nbsp;<br /> <span class="SmallText">250cal, 7g fat, 43g protein, 1070mg sodium,<br /> 6 WWpts. Dip in salsa (you can get that at Jack, too) for a low-cal,<br /> fat-free flavor boost.</span>
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top">
      <strong>Tyson Grilled Chicken Breast Strips</strong><br /> <span class="SmallText"> (4oz. portion. Prep and serve in 15<br /> minutes). 147cal, 5g fat, 23g protein, 720mg sodium, 4 WWpts. Sautee<br /> some vidalia onions with a couple sprays of olive-oil cooking spray.<br /> Adds about 15 calories, 0 WWpts+ and a ton of flavor.</span>

      <strong>Fish</strong>

    <td valign="top">
      <strong>McDonald&#8217;s Filet-O-Fish</strong><br /> <span class="SmallText"> (Sorry, this doesn&#8217;t even<br /> <em><strong>look</strong></em> appealing to me. But here&#8217;s the<br /> rundown.)<br /> 380cal, 18g fat, 15g protein, 640g sodium, 10 WWpts.</span>
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top">
      <strong>Long John Silver&#8217;s Battered Fish Filet </strong><br /> <strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><span class="SmallText">(I can&#8217;t vouch for the taste — haven&#8217;t had it).<br /> 260cal, 16g fat, 12g protein, 790mg sodium, 7 WWpts.</span>
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top">
      <strong>Trader Joe&#8217;s Marinated Ahi Tuna Steaks</strong><br /> <span class="SmallText"> (4.5 oz. portion. Prep and serve in 15 minutes).<br /> 150cal, 5g fat, 25g protein, 180mg sodium, 4 WWpts. So low-cal<br /> that you could add some rice or pasta, but you 4.5oz is a lot of fish,<br /> so you won&#8217;t be hungry!</span>

  *According to <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com" target="_blank">mayoclinic.com</a>, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium to less than 2,300 mg a day — or 1,500 mg if you&#8217;re age 51 or older, or if you are Black, or if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.
