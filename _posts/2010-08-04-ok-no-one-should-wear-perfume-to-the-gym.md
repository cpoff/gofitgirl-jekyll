There is a woman at the gym who I happen to take several classes with who bathes in perfume before she comes to class.  
I know she does because I can smell it at the 9 a.m. spin class on Saturdays. It was pretty pungent at the evening Zumba class tonight. I kept trying to move away from her. Luckily when you are jumping around you don&#8217;t actually smell it the whole time.  
I have a high sensitivity to perfumes, smelly lotions, etc. I can get nauseated and a horrible headache. It&#8217;s not fun. And I really don&#8217;t understand why someone would need to slather it on. I mean, what&#8217;s wrong with deodorant?  
Don&#8217;t get me started on the fresh lipstick &#8230;
