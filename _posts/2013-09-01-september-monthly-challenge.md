OK, for September&#8217;s Monthly Challenge I dug into my stockpile of ideas from readers from a [Comment Contest Tuesday](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/05/comment-contest-tuesday-challenge-go-fit-girl/) a few months back.  
Thanks, Nicole W. for this idea.  
Normally we have one nutrition challenge and one exercise challenge. This month they are kinda combined into one.  
This Monthly Challenge also asks for a little extra participation by GFG! readers. You&#8217;re ready for this, right?  
Like I stated yesterday, I need commitment and support from my readers. You can really show it to me with this Monthly Challenge.  
This challenge breaks down throughout this month.  
**Week 1)** Think of things you don’t have time for (a fitness class, shopping for fresh veggies instead of eating/serving frozen meals, cooking at home regularly, going for nightly walks after dinner, getting up in a little earlier for a 20-30 minute yoga practice, making it to the gym at least three times a week, going to bed at a regular time, etc.).  
**Week 1 1/2 and Week 2)** Figure out how to make time for at least one thing. Bonus points for taking on a nutrition AND exercise challenge. I will make this a Comment Contest Tuesday this coming Tuesday, the third. Readers can post their challenges and wants and needs. Other readers can suggest ways to achieve these challenges. For each challenge a reader posts their name will get thrown into a random drawing. For each suggestion to challenge posted, the reader will get their name thrown in a random drawing.  
Comment Contest Tuesday will run from Sept. 3 and end Sept. 17.  
**Weeks 3 – 4)** Spend the remainder of the month implementing the solution(s) and see if it works.  
**There is a second challenge.** This idea also came from a friend/reader of Go Fit Girl! (Though she just gave me the idea recently.) Remember my post asking, [Do you want to be happy?](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/08/do-you-want-to-be-happy/)  
For most of us I am certain the answer is yes. Maybe you already are happy and don&#8217;t want to change a thing. But I feel like there is always room for improvement.  
Take time this month, for the remainder of the year and, frankly, the rest of your life and reevaluate your life goals. Try something you have always wanted to try. Get out of your comfort zone!  
This can be simple, like trying a new exercise class or trying a new recipe, or a little more complex, such as maybe deciding to lose those 30-50 (or more or less) pounds, maybe going back to school and/or starting a new job. Is there something you have always wanted to do? What&#8217;s stopping you?  
I have decided to take on a [passion and start yoga teacher training](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/08/gfg-big-announcement/), which starts on Thursday. Eeekkk!  
You can post any updates below or try out the new [Go Fit Girl! Monthly Challenge Facebook Group page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/594110353966116/) and comment, update and converse there. Thanks, Nicole M. for the suggestion. Let&#8217;s see how this works.
