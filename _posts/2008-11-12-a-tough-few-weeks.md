So between some travel, lots of stuff going on after work and weekends, and short weeks at work I am trying to figure out how to fit in working out and staying healthy with my eating.  
And it is already tough and it is only the beginning. But so far this week I have worked out three times: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. And I plan to work out tonight after work, too.  
Eating, ugh! I did have a salad at the bar last night&#8211;no fried food, I did nibble on a few of Curt&#8217;s French fries. And no beer for me, Diet Coke. I probably woulda fallen asleep right at the table if I had a beer.  
This weekend we are heading to Missouri. We will celebrate early Thanksgiving with Curt&#8217;s family. We had a Thanksgiving potluck at work this past Monday. The weekend after this one I am heading to New Orleans with my friend Sue. I mean, I can&#8217;t not eat all the yummy food while I am there. Luckily we will be doing a lot of walking. And I checked, our hotel has a gym.  
So all I can do is my best. I am aware of situations that are coming and I am planning the best I can. So wish me luck. And the best of luck to my readers who face similar challenges.
