    The &#8220;candy baby&#8221; from Costco fills my candy bowl at work. (It&#8217;s not called a baby because it is small but because it is the size of an actual baby.)

Wow, I don&#8217;t know what happened today.  
All day all I wanted to do was eat. I had the munchies. I wanted to eat carrots and I wanted to eat candy and I wanted to eat chips and just about anything else I could get my hands on.  
Since back to a healthy routine I probably haven&#8217;t had more than a couple of pieces of candy in one day. Normally I don&#8217;t have any.  
I lost count on the amount of Rolos, Reese&#8217;s, and Peanut M&Ms that went in my mouth.  
It&#8217;s a good thing I gave myself some [wiggle room](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=9717) to work with when hitting my goal weight minus two.  
I don&#8217;t know if the munchies were because I have been awesome in the healthy lifestyle and needed a break or because of my cycle or because I gave myself permission to have whatever I want starting Wednesday (but I actually started Monday) or or just because today was a day with major munchies and snacking needed.  
I did go to my regular Monday night gym class and sweated a ton of calories off. Woo-hoo! And then I came home and made a high veggie dinner with a little bit of shrimp: filling, delicious and healthy. Just the way I like it.  
Man, I love veggies. Thank God I love vegetables!  
And, of course, I have had a ton of water. I had one cup of coffee this morning and then the rest of the day has been just lots and lots of water.
