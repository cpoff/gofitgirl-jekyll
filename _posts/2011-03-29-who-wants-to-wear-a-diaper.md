I went to possibly my last Tuesday spin class. (Still trying to figure out my workout sked with my company move.)  
Curt got me an REI gift card for Christmas. I recently used part of it to buy some [cycling boxer shorts](http://www.rei.com/product/794385?cm_mmc=cse_nextag-_-datafeed-_-product-_-794385&mr:referralID=a38e30f0-5a83-11e0-a86a-001b2166c2c0). I have never wanted to buy padded cycling shorts or pants as they feel like you have a load in your diaper. (Plus, they are pretty expensive.) The cycling boxer shorts go under workout clothes or regular &#8220;street&#8221; clothes.  
I finally remembered to pack the cycling boxers in my gym bag for spin tonight. For the most part I liked them. They were a little tight on my legs. And they rode up a little. But they provided good padding without feeling like a load in my diaper.  
At the end of class Boku gave me his CD playlist he made for class as a parting gift. I thought that was really awesome. A lot of time Boku has theme music. Today was all songs he has heard while at the ballpark since baseball season officially starts this week.
