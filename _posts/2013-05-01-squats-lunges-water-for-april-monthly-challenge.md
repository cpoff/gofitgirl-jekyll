One of the things that stuck with me with last month&#8217;s challenge was that a few mentioned they liked that it could be done at home. I know for a variety of reasons people can&#8217;t get to a gym or yoga studio.  
I will do my best for future challenges to make it accessible for most. But, of course, you are always welcome to adjust to challenge for yourself accordingly.  
Since summer is upon us, let&#8217;s prepare for it.  
**Exercise:** Let&#8217;s work those thighs, butt and hips. We can work these body parts with squats, lunges and a variety of yoga poses.  
Usually I like to give a number&#8211;do 500 or 1,000 a week. If you want a number, try to get in a 1,000 squats, lunges, any other exercise or yoga pose to work those areas each week. If the number idea doesn&#8217;t work for you, let&#8217;s just focus on those areas.  
**Nutrition:** We roughly need at least 64 ounces of water a day. Another way to look at it is you should have half your body weight in water. For example: If you weigh 150 pounds, you should drink 75 ounces of water a day. If you aren&#8217;t getting your minimum in, focus on that this month.  
If you are getting your minimum in, make sure you get in a little extra with caffeine intake and/or exercise. If your minimum intake is healthy, try to get one more serving in a day, every day this month.  
Remember, everything in moderation. You can definitely drink too much water. I don&#8217;t think most of us are in jeopardy of that. Just as an FYI: A gallon of water is 128 ounces, which is is 16 8-ounce servings.  
Make sure you drink your water throughout the day. Chugging a large amount of water at once can cause issues with your electrolytes. Be careful.  
[This Livestrong article](http://www.livestrong.com/article/424740-what-are-the-benefits-of-drinking-a-gallon-of-water-a-day/) explains why getting in a healthy amount of water every day will help you live a healthy life.
