This morning I attended the Hatha Yoga class instead of Vinyasa because we had brunch plans with out of state friends.  
Hatha isn&#8217;t as intense as my regular Sunday Vinyasa class. But it was a good class and I like the teacher. I have had her as a sub before and she teaches the Sunday Restorative Yoga class.  
I do regularly practice Hatha with a Â class taught by Baxter on Wednesday evenings.  
Vickie had us hold Downward Dog for 5 minutes in class this morning. It felt a lot longer than that. And it was rather intense. My arms and shoulders are a little sore after doing weights yesterday in body conditioning.  
And my hands kept slipping on my mat. I have a cheap mat. I have been thinking about getting a new spendy yoga mat. I need to do a little research before I make the investment.
