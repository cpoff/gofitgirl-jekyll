Join me from 9:30-11 a.m. for a morning of yoga with a focus on gratitude and self care.  
We will practice gratitude while recognizing how blessed we are in this life.  
Extend your deepest gratitude for this moment and for all of the many blessings that bring you joy in your life.  
We will come together for a Hatha alignment-based practice as we move mindfully while breathing deeply.  
We will explore yoga poses that aid in digestion, detoxing naturally and cleansing.  
We will also open our hearts with some supportive Restorative Yoga poses to end our class.  
All levels are supported and welcome.  
Suggested donation of $5. If you can afford $5, you pay $5. If you can&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t, which allows yoga to be accessible to all.
