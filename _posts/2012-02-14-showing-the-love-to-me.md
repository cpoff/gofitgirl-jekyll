[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8528" title="valetines" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/valetines-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/valetines.jpg)Today is Valentine&#8217;s Day. I find the holiday silly and pretty much pointless. If you are single, you feel bad that you are. If you are in a relationship, you feel pressure. Curt and I don&#8217;t give gifts or cards. If we can, we do go out to dinner and eat delicious sushi.  
Last night in Baxter&#8217;s Hatha class we focused on our heart and opening it up. (Baxter likes to do themes. Last week we focused on the feet.)  
We set an intention at the beginning of class. I set mine for someone else. But during class I really thought about my heart being opened up and taking care of me.  
 I, like many women, feel that I must take care of everyone else. Which usually means I sacrifice taking care of myself. (Part of it is also that I am a control freak. But we don&#8217;t need to talk about that now.)  
But how I take care of myself and love myself is by making sure I regularly exercise, try to eat healthy, cut back my caffeine intake, try to keep my alcohol drinking to weekends and to a minimum. I also enjoy knitting and watching TV and movies and blogging among other things. I do these things because they fulfill me in very different ways. I wish I read more. During my de-cluttering of the bookshelf over the weekend I organized my books by books I have read and books I haven&#8217;t read but want to. I hope the organization and the easy access will encourage my reading.  
Probably the No. 1 way I regularly take care of myself is regularly exercising. Even if I am eating too many calories or drinking too much caffeine or alcohol or watching way too much TV I still manage to keep up with the regular workouts. I exercise on average six times a week.  
What do you do to take care of yourself and love yourself?  
It has been a few months since I have hosted a Comment Contest Tuesday. So, let&#8217;s give it a whirl.  
OK, here are all the rules for this week’s Comment Contest Tuesday. You can comment as much as you want. Each comment in its own post will get your name thrown into the random drawing twice.  
To participate in Comment Contest Tuesday you must submit your answers in the comments below. The comment has to be relevant to what I am asking: What do you do to take care of yourself and love yourself?  
Comments via e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, etc. don’t count. You have until Friday, Feb. 17, noon my time to comment away.  
 I can&#8217;t wait to hear what you all have to say.
