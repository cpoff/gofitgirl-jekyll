Someone recently asked me for suggestions on how to healthily survive a 10-hour flight.  
My advice was not good. I told him that I survive international flights with booze and a sleeping pill.  
Seriously, here is my advice on how to survive an international flight or even a domestic flight:  
Stay hydrated. Drink lots of water before, during and after the flight.  
Avoid alcohol before and during the flight. (For the record, I don&#8217;t take this advice.)  
Take healthy snacks with you: fruit, nuts, peanut butter crackers, pretzels, even a sandwich.  
Walk around every once in a while.  
If a meal is offered, go with the healthiest option. (Go with the chicken or fish.) You can probably view the menu online for preplanning.  
Don&#8217;t beat yourself up when you stray and have a drink or don&#8217;t have enough water or chow down on something super unhealthy. All we can do is our best. And we do slip up. And hell, most of the time when I travel I am on vacation. And one of the greatest things about going on vacation (especially when traveling somewhere new, exotic, international or just awesome) is the food and drink.  
We head to Missouri tomorrow. I am looking forward to some good home cooking and some barbecue. We also will be having an early Thanksgiving celebration with Curt&#8217;s parents, his brother and our two nephews. There will be lots of eating and good food.
