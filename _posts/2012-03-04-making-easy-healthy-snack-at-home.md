    Homemade Peanut Butter Balls, which I made this morning.
  </p>
</div>

  
My friend and co-worker Regina let me try a homemade Peanut Butter Ball one day on the shuttle on our way home. It was so good. So I asked her for the recipe.  
I went to the grocery this morning for my regular run and to get the ingredients for the Peanut Butter Balls. I found everything except for the the ground flaxseed.  
I really wanted to make the recipe and was not willing to hit another store this morning.  
(I hate grocery shopping and had limited time this morning as I had to cook a few things before yoga class.)  
So I figured it would be OK to replace the flaxseed with sesame seeds. I like sesame seeds, so I figured it would be OK. (I realize there are likely ([yup, according to WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/benefits-of-flaxseed)) more benefits to using the flaxseed than sesame seeds, such as fiber. But [sesame seeds](http://www.nutrition-and-you.com/sesame-seeds.html) have health benefits, too.  
I made my sesame seed Peanut Butter Balls today. And they are pretty good. I may adjust the peanut butter next time and add a little more. But these were super easy to make and a good snack, too.  
In case you want to make your own Energy Balls, follow the recipe here:  
1 cup regular oatmeal  
1/2 cup peanut butter  
1/3 cup pure, unfiltered honey  
1 cup coconut flakes  
1/2 cup ground flaxseed  
1/2 cup chocolate chips (or craisins or raisins or another sweetness of your choice)  
1 or 2 tsp of vanilla extract  
Using your hands, mix all the ingredients well in a bowl. Let it chill for at least 1/2 hour in the fridge. After the mixture is chilled, use a teaspoon to size out scoops of the mixture and roll into balls. Will keep in Tupperware in the fridge for seven days. Enjoy!
