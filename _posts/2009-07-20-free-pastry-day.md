Tomorrow is free pastry day at Starbucks.  
[Here is the link to the coupon](http://www.starbucks.com/retail/print_free_pastry.html) if you would like it.  
I find it frustrating that Starbucks doesn&#8217;t have nutritional information for their goodies. They do for their drinks&#8211;which can be a rude awakening if you look up your favorite drink. After reading that information you may need tons of sugar and calories to get you out of shock.

OK, I know you aren&#8217;t going to believe this, but I was wrong. You have to click like 300 times before you can find goodie nutritional information on the Starbucks site&#8211;it is there, just not that easily.  
Here are a few of their goodies listed:  
The <span>Apple Bran Muffin with Omega 3&#8217;s & 7g Fiber has 350 calories and 9 grams of fat; <span>Reduced-Fat Very Berry Coffee Cake has 320 calories and 9 grams of fat; Blueberry Scone has 460 calories and 22 grams of fat.</span></span>

  Starbucks does claim in their new recipes:
</p>

No artificial flavors; No artificial trans fat; No artificial dyes; No high-fructose corn syrup (These things are really great. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that their goodies aren&#8217;t still loaded with sugar and fat. Just an FYI.)  
Peet&#8217;s has [nutrional information](http://www.peets.com/stores/baked_goods.asp) for their goodies. So we will assume that they are very similar to Starbucks and check out a few for some pure shock value.  
Blueberry muffin: 480 calories 21 grams of fat; pumpkin scone: 430 calories 23 grams of fat; butter croissant: 380 calories 22 grams of fat.  
Some low-fat options: Low fat Banana blueberry muffin: 290 calories 3 grams of fat; blueberry cranberry scone: 250 calories 11 grams of fat.  
So even the low fat ain&#8217;t that healthy. You are probably better off just eating an apple. According to [Calorie King](http://www.calorieking.com/foods/calories-in-fruit-fresh-apples-with-skin-raw-edible-portion_f-Y2lkPTM3MDY4JmJpZD0xJmZpZD02Mzg3OCZlaWQ9NDQ1NDczNzc3JnBvcz0xJnBhcj0ma2V5PWFwcGxl.html), an apple has 55 calories and .2 grams of fat. And just for the sake of looking things up, a banana has 72 calories and .2 grams of fat.
