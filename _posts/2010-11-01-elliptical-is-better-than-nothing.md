Today something was going on at work so I missed my noon spin class.Â I planned to go to the evening spin class. But I really wanted to watch the Giants game tonight.  
So I worked out on the elliptical at the gym in my work building. It wasn&#8217;t the greatest workout ever. But it was better than nothing. And really I could have just said, eh, I won&#8217;t work out today.  
Glad I did it and I feel less guilty while I am sitting on my butt watching the game and drinking a beer.  
Plus now I have worked out four days in a row. YEA! Yoga on Friday night; spin/abs/core/body conditioning on Saturday; yoga Sunday; and elliptical today. Not too shabby for someone who is trying to get back on track.
