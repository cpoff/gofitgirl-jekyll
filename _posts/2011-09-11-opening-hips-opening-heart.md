Today in Vinyasa Yoga class we set intentions. Sometimes I set one for myself, someone I care or someone I know needs a little extra love. Today I set mine for the 9/11 victims. Generic and broad, yes. But there were so many victims on so many levels.  
We focused a lot of the class today on opening the hips. We also focused on opening our hearts, which seemed appropriate for today.  
We had a sub today. The class was good and tough. But a little tough to follow. Her flows were different than my regular Sunday class. I am sure the more I take Lily&#8217;s classes the better I will get.  
She had us work on two poses I have never done before: [tripod headstand](http://www.fitsugar.com/Strike-Yoga-Pose-Tripod-Headstand-1981577) and [tortoise](http://media.onsugar.com/files/ons1/192/1922729/33_2009/67588fbf2d1f1e08_Tortiose-pose.jpg). Neither of which I could do fully, and barely partially. My version of tripod headstand looked more like dolphin, with my head touching the mat.  
I am planning on attending the Restorative Yoga class this evening. I haven&#8217;t been in weeks. And I feel I need it and deserve it. I anticipate this week to be a little stressful with work and getting ready to travel this weekend to Tucson. (My postings may be minimal this week. But stay tuned. I will return fully next week.)
