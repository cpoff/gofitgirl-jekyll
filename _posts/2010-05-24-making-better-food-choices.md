Today was Day 1 of getting back to maintaining a healthier way of eating/living/exercising. (And I really needed to detox after the way I have been eating lately, especially this past weekend. There was a lot of eating out, drinking, having deliciously unhealthy food. I wish I didn&#8217;t love cheese so much.)  
I had oatmeal and coffee for breakfast; yogurt for a morning snack; then headed to spin on my lunch break.  
After spin I was really craving a cobb salad from [Soup Freaks](http://www.soupfreaks.com/). Before I headed over for my salad I decided to look up the nutritional information. I really wanted lentil soup and cobb salad. I decided to just go with the lentil soup and a piece of wheat bread. The lentil soup was delicious and very filing.  
I did have leftover thin crust pizza for dinner. But I had enough points for that. (Yup, back to tracking my food.)  
My goal is to get back to my goal weight and keep it there instead of these 5 pounds going up and down and up and down. I am trying to take this one day at a time. Because there will always be a roadblock&#8211;like a three day weekend with a housewarming party planned, a girls&#8217; day with a girlfriend, etc.
