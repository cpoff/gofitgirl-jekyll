For all the crap, sweets, fatty foods I ate and all the beer and wine I drank I have to say the weight gain as a total isn&#8217;t bad. I have to lose 5.4 pounds to get back to my goal weight.  
Today is Day 1 of eating much healthier. It&#8217;s hard. But I am resisting the urge to eat crap.  
For breakfast I had coffee and instant oatmeal. For lunch I had salad with spritzer and Zesty-Tomato Thyme soup. For a snack I am having an apple with peanut butter.
