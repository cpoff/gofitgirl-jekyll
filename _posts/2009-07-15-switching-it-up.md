I couldn&#8217;t attend my normal Wednesday morning yoga class today because I attended a CPR certification class and had to be at work a little earlier to be there on time for the start of the class.  
So I went to the 6:30 p.m. spin class after work.  
This is a weird week for me between work schedule, short week, being out of town, etc.  
Curt and I are heading to Napa tomorrow night&#8211;so no spin after work. And I have a lunch meeting so no lunch time spin (with my Saturday spin teacher). I briefly thought about taking the 6:15 a.m. spin class tomorrow. And I realized that that was way too nuts and there was no way in hell I was getting up at 5:30 in the morning. That would make my day just way too long.  
I took that 6:15 class once. It was so hard. And by 2 p.m. I was ready to crawl under my desk and take a nap&#8211;I really hit the mat.  
I am really hoping to at least get a 20-minute walk in sometime tomorrow. I need to just sked it on my calendar and go!  
Friday and Saturday there won&#8217;t be any working out. Just eating and drinking wine! And we are going to a cooking class. So I am sure the food will be delicious&#8211;just not sure if it is weight-watching friendly. (I think I can guess on that one.)  
Curt and I will come back home Saturday afternoon/evening. I likely will be &#8220;tired&#8221; after wine tasting. I hope to get some sort of workout in Sunday morning because we have plans starting about noon for the rest of the day &#8230;
