There is a yoga sub at my gym who I just don&#8217;t like. His style is fine, it is a little odd. But it is a good practice.  
It is his tone that drives me up the wall. Breeaaathhe in breeeaaatthe out. Exhaaaale. Ugh, it just drags out.  
I saw him this morning before class started and thought ugh. Then I reminded myself that I wanted to have a good practice. So I tried to have a good attitude about it.
