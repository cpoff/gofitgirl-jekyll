We did some crazy squats (lunges, too) yesterday in body conditioning. And man, am I sore today. The later the day goes the more pain I am in. The longer I sit the harder it is for me to get up and move around.  
But it is a good kind of sore. Now if that soreness would just turn into buns and thighs of steel &#8230;
