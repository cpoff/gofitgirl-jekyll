    A warm cup of coffee and oatmeal with bananas and peanut butter are my usual breakfast routine.

Can you believe it? It&#8217;s December! This year flew by.  
My morning routine is usually the same. I wake up somewhere between 6:30 and 7 a.m.  
I practice my home yoga practice for about an hour. I head downstairs for my coffee and breakfast. Then back upstairs to get ready for my day.  
The majority of my days I have a morning class. (Four days a week I have a 9:15 a.m. cycle class, one day a week an 8:30 a.m. yoga class, four days a week a noon yoga class &#8230;)  
When I head downstairs for my coffee and breakfast I usually sit and enjoy my quiet time. Depending on the day and when I actually get downstairs I have anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to have my breakfast.  
My goal is to sit and enjoy my meal and coffee. I open the blinds of the patio doors and watch the rain, the birds, the same guy running for the bus or whatever is going on outside and I sip my coffee.  
When I was working 40+ hours a week with a usual 2-hour total a day commute finding 15 minutes to just be was tough. I drank my coffee and had my breakfast at work, at my desk, while working. Not the best way to start off with the most important meal of the day.  
I could have gotten up earlier to get that 15 minutes in. But that would mean I would be getting up at 4:30 or 4:45 instead of my usual 5 a.m. Yea, no, thanks.  
It&#8217;s December. Which means for most people life is nuts, socially, end of the year at work, parties, gatherings, drinking, eating, shopping, travel, family, friends &#8230;  
When we feel like we don&#8217;t have time for that 15 minutes of quiet time is when we really need it.  
Last year for the month of December my teacher Vickie challenged her students to practice 15 minutes of Savasana every day. I did it andÂ [wrote about it](http://gofitgirl.com/2014/12/took-savasana-challenge/).  
Go Fit Girl&#8217;s December Monthly Challenge is to take 15 minutes once a day to just be. It could be to sip your coffee or tea, to read, to take bath, to do a 15-minute yoga practice, to look out the window, to meditate, to practice Savasana, take a walk, stare at the ceiling, read a book or magazine, really enjoy your meal.  
When you take your 15 minutes be present in what you are doing. If you take a 15-minute walk, don&#8217;t also look at your phone. Breathe in the fresh air, enjoy the scene in front of you.  
Your 15 minutes can be whenever you want. First thing in the morning, end of the day, maybe a break at work during slump time.  
And if you miss a day, don&#8217;t beat yourself up. There&#8217;s always tomorrow.
