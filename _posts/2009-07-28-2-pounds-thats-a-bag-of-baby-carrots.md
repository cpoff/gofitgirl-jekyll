So I recently put myself back on plan. I didn&#8217;t want to write about it right away. Because it seems like lately every time I do I screw it up. I am trying to take a different approach and different attitude this time around.  
Well, it paid off. I stepped on the scale today and I lost 2 pounds, on the dot.  
I have been tracking my food since last Monday. My goal is to weigh in on Mondays. Yesterday was super insane at work. Today wasn&#8217;t much better. But I made sure before it got too crazy that I took the 5-10 minutes to weigh in.  
Even though I was exhausted at work I was in such a good mood after seeing that my hard work this past week had paid off.  
For those of you who don&#8217;t know, about two years ago I lost 30+ pounds. I have done pretty well with keeping it off and maintaining my weight. Lately the food intake has been unhealthy and some ridiculous portions. The exercise has been pretty consistent. So I know that it is really about what I am eating and drinking.
