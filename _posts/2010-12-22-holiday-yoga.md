I was able to leave work tonight at a reasonable hour (the two days before that were 12-hour days) and hit yoga at the studio near my house.  
I really like Baxter&#8217;s style. And class tonight proved my approval once again.  
Baxter made our class more of a Christmas theme. Instead of downward dog it was downward donkey; cat cow became Rudolph the Reindeer; we were introduced to the three wise men, etc. He had us all cracking up and having a good time.
