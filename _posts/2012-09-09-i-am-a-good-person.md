    I was brought up by an amazing woman who taught me how to be a good person.

I believe in religious rights, which means I believe people can practice or not practice any religion one chooses. I may not agree with your choice. But it is yours. And as long as you don&#8217;t try to put your beliefs on me we are cool.  
I also believe in the separation of Church and State.  
I grew up as a Catholic. I was [confirmed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_(Catholic_Church)) at 16. I am now a non-practicing Catholic and have been for about 20 years.  
Recently I have been having numerous conversations about what it means to be a Christian.  
This really has me thinking and wondering why it is so important for so many to be labeled or to label others as a [Christian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian).  
Isn&#8217;t a good person a good person regardless of their religious affiliation? Muslims, Jews, agnostics, atheists, Buddhists are among those that are not Christian. I know people who represent all those I just mentioned and they are good, kind, decent, loving people.  
I consider myself a Christian and a good person. Those two don&#8217;t always go hand in hand.  
We live in a world where there is so much cruelty and judgment.  
Don&#8217;t we all have enough going on in our own lives that we have no time, or frankly, business judging others?  
Does the Bible tell us that we should judge others?  
And all the stories I have heard about Jesus makes him sound like a very open-minded non-judgmental person.  
Isn&#8217;t that how we should all thrive to be?  
To quote Charlotte from [Sex and the City](http://www.hbo.com/sex-and-the-city/index.html): I choose my choice. And if I choose to have an abortion that is between me and me (or me and God). If I choose to have an affair &#8230; to get divorced &#8230; to live with my boyfriend before I am married &#8230;  
There are consequences to every choice we make&#8211;good or bad. And we must face them.  
I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I am a child of multiple divorces. It was important for me to not quickly jump into a marriage. We were together about four years before we got married and I wanted to make sure I could live with another person. So I lived with my boyfriend before I got married. And almost 9 years later we are still married (together almost 13).  
My choices are my choices and my business. And whatever comes of the choices I make I will face the consequences &#8230; and not the judgment of others.  
And don&#8217;t forget we all make mistakes and are all sinners and we all deserve love and forgiveness.  
I have my own beliefs and they are mine&#8211;I don&#8217;t try to put them on anyone else but me.
