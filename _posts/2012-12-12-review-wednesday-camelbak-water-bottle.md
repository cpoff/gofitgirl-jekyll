I have been using various [Camelbak water bottles](http://astore.amazon.com/gofigi-20/detail/B007OX9X9K A) for years.  
I like to call mine an adult sippy cup. The water bottle with the built-in straw for some reason makes me drink more water. I have a 16 ounce/500 mL bottle, which worked just great for me.  
A few months back I decided to get a 24 ounce/750 mL bottle. And I have to say with that thing I drink even more water than I did before.  
I monitor how much water I drink (well, to a point). My goal is to get in at least eight servings a day. After that I usually stop counting.  
Most days without fail I hit that goal and beyond. But there are still days where I struggle. But that&#8217;s me not the water bottle.

The only negative with the bottle is that it is a pain to clean. You can buy the official [Camelbak bottle cleaner](http://astore.amazon.com/gofigi-20/detail/B0054XI6ZE) at Go Fit Girl!&#8217;s Amazon store.  
At first I just used a cotton swab to clean the inside of the nipple and used a regular bottle cleaner for the inside of the bottle. Then one of my co-workers told me she bought a baby bottle cleaner for hers. I tried it and was amazed at how easy it was to clean. So I got my own [baby bottle cleaner](http://astore.amazon.com/gofigi-20/detail/B0075RNUWG) and use that to clean my Camelbak. It&#8217;s still a little bit of a chore. But much easier.  
Whatever size you are thinking … it would make a great stocking stuffer.  
So really, the only negative is that it is a chore to clean.  
The fact that I drink so much water is all that really matters. And I take that thing almost every where I go.  
I give the Camelbak water bottle 4 1/2 dumbbells.
