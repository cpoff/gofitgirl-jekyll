Lately my work/life balance is balanced by making sure I go to the gym, eat fairly healthy and enjoy life on the weekends &#8230; and work 1o hour days.  
This week the life balance has been pretty bad. I went to yoga twice this week. No spin. There is too much candy, sweet, yummy, tasty crap at the office. And I am stuffing my face. I am working way too much. Feeling rather underappreciated.  
I have been exhausted this week. I have had so much to do at work and at home. Luckily home stuff is winding down.  
I hope things get a little back to normal next week.
