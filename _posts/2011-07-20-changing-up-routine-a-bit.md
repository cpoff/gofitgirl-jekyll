    My dinner tonight: spicy black bean burger and a side salad.
  </p>
</div>

  
The commute on the shuttle bus from South San Francisco took more than an hour. Traffic was bad, likely because of the Giants baseball game.  
I didn&#8217;t get home until about 5:50, just 10 minutes before my regular Wednesday night yoga class. When we were sitting in traffic I made up my mind that I would try the later class at 7:30. I have been wanting to try it&#8211;so this seems like a good reason to do so.  
The class goes until 9, which is when I usually start winding down for bed. So I have already done my routine stuff: clothes ready for tomorrow; exercise clothes ready for tomorrow; light dinner ([spicy black bean Morningstar burger](http://www.morningstarfarms.com/MorningStarFarmsSpicyBlackBeanVeggieBurgers_345.html), which was really tasty, and side salad with Salad Spritzer).  
Hopefully I won&#8217;t get too comfy before I have to leave for the yoga studio. I have about a half an hour before I start my walk over.
