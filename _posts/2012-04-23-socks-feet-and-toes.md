With an REI gift card I recently purchased a yoga mat bag, a special yoga/sweat towel and some new socks.  
After all of these years of exercising and spinning and I hadn&#8217;t given much thought to the socks I wore. I have fun little shorty socks. But they don&#8217;t give much cushion, support or protection.  
And sometimes they rub or not protect my feet so well and I end up with a slight blister or sore spot.  
Almost two years ago I bought some [adidas socks](http://www.adidas.com/us/product/womens-training-soft-and-light-no-show-socks-6-pair/LB771AK?cid=Q10173&breadcrumb=swZ1z13xg9Zu3) while at an adidas store in the city. They are decent socks.  
But I wanted to look into buying some better socks. The cycle socks are pretty expensive. I looked at the running socks and they were a little more reasonable. I got a couple of REI brand pairs and two pairs of [Wigwam socks](http://www.rei.com/product/831732/wigwam-zippy-socks-womens-2-pack).  
I LOVE the Wigwam socks. They are cushioned and feel so good, whether I am spinning, walking or even just wearing my Chuck Taylors. I will definitely be buying more of these socks. Two pair are so worth the 18 bucks.  
Feet are such an important part of our bodies. And we abuse them so much. I know I do&#8211;with high heels or shoes that don&#8217;t quite fit so well. And my feet feel so good while they are in the Wigwam socks.
