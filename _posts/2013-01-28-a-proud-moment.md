As Michelle was proud of her husband last Monday, I have warm fuzzy feelings about mine as well.  
Curt started a new job last Monday. After almost 8 years at one employer he made the decision to make the move to change jobs. This is a good move for him and his career and I am supportive.  
Almost two weeks ago was his last day at his former employer. There were going-away drinks for him in the city that night. So I made my way to the city (aka San Francisco) to join him, his co-workers and some of our friends.  
There were lots of people at the outing. Many I knew, some I didn&#8217;t.  
I heard more than once that it was the biggest going away drinks attended. I also heard that Curt brought out a bunch of formers for his send-off.  
And lastly, many people I met for the first time kept saying what a &#8220;good guy&#8221; he is. Many were going to miss him terribly.  
When you love someone and you hear others say nice things about them it gives you this amazing feeling. Pride. Love. Joy.  
Since I am not a parent I imagine that this is kinda how a parent feels when proud of a child.  
And the new job for The Husband seems to be going well.
