This week has been rough for me. Emotionally draining.  
Monday I didn&#8217;t work and went to a very inspiring and emotionally uplifting yoga class. The energy I felt afterward was amazing. I was almost giddy.  
Then Tuesday happened. I came home from work exhausted. I still went to yoga. And I never regret dragging myself to practice.  
When I got home from class I told myself there was no need to go online. I didn&#8217;t need to post anything on Go Fit Girl! and I didn&#8217;t need to look at Facebook. So I just showered, made and ate dinner, drank a beer and vegged in front of the TV before bed.  
Last night was pretty much the same, minus the beer.  
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I can&#8217;t go long without the Internets, my blogging and research, Facebook, Twitter, etc. But it was definitely a nice and much needed break. It was refreshing actually.  
I worked from home today because I need to go into the office tomorrow.  
Because my schedule was flexible I was able to make a massage appointment. Thanh always make me feel better. And as she was working my back and shoulders I could feel how tight and how much stress was/is balled up in there.  
I am keeping up with my exercise and maintaining a healthy eating plan. Many times when I fall into challenging times I just eat and drink whatever. But I am really working hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle as I plug away at life&#8217;s many challenges.
