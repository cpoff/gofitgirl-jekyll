My dad and brother collaborated and self-published a [children&#8217;s book](http://chainsaw-munkey.deviantart.com/art/The-Boy-Who-Didn-t-Like-Bananas-405056217), The Boy Who Didn&#8217;t Like Bananas.  
Michael, my dad, wrote and John, brother, illustrated.  
Bananas are nutritionally good for your body.  
And reading is nutritionally good for your brain.  
Bananas &#8220;are delicious. Not to mention that they&#8217;re very nutritious.&#8221;  
A [medium-sized banana](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1846/2) has about 100 calories, 3 grams of fiber and not even 1 gram of protein.  
According to the [Chiquita Banana website](http://www.chiquitabananas.com/Worlds-Favorite-Fruit/index-banana-nutrition-facts.aspx) under health and nutrition some nutrition facts provided are:

  * Safe and pure enough for baby&#8217;s first solid food, <a href="http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Switching-To-Solid-Foods.aspx" target="_blank">according to the American Academy of Pediatrics</a>.
  * Bananas are a terrific, heart-healthy food when included in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
  * Naturally fat-, cholesterol- and sodium-free.
  * A good source of potassium, dietary fiber, manganese and vitamins B6 & C.

There is also a yoga pose called [Banana (Bananasana)](http://gofitgirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/banana-e1352584623799.jpg), which according to the [Yin Yoga website](http://www.yinyoga.com/index.php) is a delicious way to stretch the whole side of the body and stretches the oblique stomach muscles and the side intercostal muscles between the ribs, among some other benefits.  
The book has a nice message. I feel that bullying is addressed in a light way. We are reminded that we all like and don&#8217;t like certain things and that&#8217;s OK.  
I know my brother is talented. But wow, the drawings are magnificent. John captured my dad&#8217;s fun and entertaining words brilliantly.  
The drawings are pretty amazing and kid friendly. The text rhymes and is a fun story.  
This story will put a smile on your face.  
I bought two copies of the book. One for me and one for our little German friend for her birthday. Curt and I send our little friends books in English and music CDs of American kid songs.  
Are you are looking for a good and inexpensive gift for a great a kid in your life for an upcoming holiday (or any other reason)? I recommend the &#8220;banana book.&#8221;  
The book is $9.95 (plus shipping if needed). E-mail John (anti.hero.brand@gmail.com) if you are interested in buying a book or two or three. If you are in Tucson, you can find the books at one of these three locations: [Charlie&#8217;s Comics](http://www.charliescomics.com), [Mostly Books](http://www.mostlybooksaz.com) and [Antigone Books](http://www.antigonebooks.com).

    The price is right and the book is great and gets 4 1/2 dumbbells. Yes, I am related to the creators of the book. But I feel that my review is thorough and fair.
