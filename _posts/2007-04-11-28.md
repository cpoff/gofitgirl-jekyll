So my weight loss had been on a little hiatus recently. I would lose a little, gain a little, lose a little, etc. It was getting frustrating because I wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. I reevaluated and decided I needed to start tracking my food again. (And I recently was overindulging in the food dept. Gotta stop that!)  
At weigh-in today I was down 2.8 pounds from last week for a total of 22 pounds lost! Just 7.6 pounds to go. I can see the light!!!!  
Plus I have been exercising a little more rigorously. Doing more of the walking/running. I am still only averaging about 3 workouts a week. I would like to be at 4 a week. But I am slowly working toward that.  
I can&#8217;t wait to be able to go shopping soon for some new pants!
