I went to spin last night.  
I am really not into the newer kickboxing class/teacher. Too many combos and we never hit anything! So lately I have been going to a body conditioning class on Thursdays at lunch, which my Saturday spin instructor teaches. I couldn&#8217;t go yesterday, so I tried the evening spin class with John.  
Spin is the hardest class I have ever taken. I have gotten much better at it. But there are some days where my lungs are tight and my thighs can barely keep up with the pedaling. (That&#8217;s usually when Jennifer asks me if I am OK.)  
The first time I took spin I looked at the clock every two minutes. So the class moved like a turtle. So now my goal is to only look at the clock every 15 minutes. I have somehow gotten pretty good at it. And I am excited when it is a little later&#8211;like 17 after the hour or 38 after the hour&#8211;when I take a peek at the huge clock.  
If you are in the second row in class it is difficult to not look at the huge honkin clock staring at you.
