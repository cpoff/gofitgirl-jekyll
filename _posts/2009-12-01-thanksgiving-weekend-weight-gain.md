So I am happy to report that my holiday weekend weight gain wasn&#8217;t too bad.  
I had planned to weigh in Wednesday. But that didn&#8217;t happen.  
When I weighed in on Nov. 23 I was just .2 away from my goal weight. And now I am .8 away from my goal weight. Not too shabby. I find this quite encouraging.  
I think a lot of my success is careful eating and exercise. I indulged a little over the weekend&#8211;but I didn&#8217;t go crazy. Another help in success is my garden vegetable soup. That is helping me keep on track.
