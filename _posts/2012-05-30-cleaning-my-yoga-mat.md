    I used a mixture of witch hazel, tea tree oil and water to clean my Jade Yoga mat.

Last year I wrote about [cleaning my yoga mat](http://gofitgirl.com/?p=5064). I had a fairly inexpensive yoga mat and took a chance by throwing it into the washer. It dried rather quickly and seemed like a successful cleaning of the mat.  
I now have a [Jade Yoga mat](http://www.jadeyoga.com/store/yoga-mats-execise-mats-pilates-mats/), which is rather expensive. And the material is different.  
According to the [Jade Yoga website](http://www.jadeyoga.com/store/help.php?section=FAQ) you can throw the mat into a front load washer (which we don&#8217;t have) or wipe down or soak in the bathtub. It mentions that oils, solvents or harsh abrasives should not be used.  
The [Yoga Journal website](http://www.yogajournal.com/basics/631) also gives some tips on how to clean a yoga mat.  
Last week while I was leaving [Namaste](http://namasteoakland.com/) I asked the woman working the front desk what she recommended to clean my mat. She told me the studio uses witch hazel and water, 25% and 75%. Spray the mat liberally, but don&#8217;t soak. Then rub down with wet hot towel. She said a little tea tree oil could also be added as it is an antibacterial.  
I added very little oil to my mixture. I only cleaned one side of my mat in case the oil made it slippery. I have used my mat twice since I cleaned it and it isn&#8217;t any slippery than normal. When in [Downward Dog](http://www.active.com/Assets/Mind+$!26+Body/Downward+Facing+Dog_Enlarged.jpg) my hands sometimes move slightly. There are [towels and covers](http://www.manduka.com/us/shop/categories/products/towels/equa-mat-towel/) that can help with that. I call it a successful cleaning.  
According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_tree_oil), tea tree oil has been scientifically investigated only recently. Some sources suggest beneficial medical properties when applied topically, including antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiseptic qualities.  
I have recently started using [tea tree oil shampoo](http://www.avalonorganics.com/?id=88&pid=30) and [conditioner](http://www.avalonorganics.com/index.php?id=89&pid=41), which helps with dry scalp. I recently for the first time massaged my scalp with straight tea tree oil. I read somewhere that it is good for you hair and scalp to spray a mixture of water and tea tree oil onto the hair and scalp.
