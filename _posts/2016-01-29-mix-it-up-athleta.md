Next weekend I will be partnering up with Athleta.  
I will be at [Athleta Washington Square](http://stores.athleta.net/store-4642/) next Saturday, Feb. 6 for Mix It Up!  
The Mix It Up! event has participants mixing up their workout style in a fitness class mashup &#8212; Athleta will be hosting two distinct 30 minute workouts that you might not otherwise put together.  
At Athleta Washington Square the mix up will be 30 minutes of yoga with Go Fit Girl! (aka Ann) and 30 minutes of boot camp with Stephanie from [Fit Body Boot Camp](http://www.fitbodybootcamp.com/hillsborofitnessbootcamp/).  
The fitness mashup begins at 9 a.m.  
After the two workouts there will be a styling session while getting some pointers on print-mixing. Attend the event for a chance to win a pair of tights.  
Feel free to bring friends along with a mat and water bottle and get ready to have some fun.
