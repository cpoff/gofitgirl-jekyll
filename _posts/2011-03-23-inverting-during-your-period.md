The yoga instructors I have been taught by tell women not to do inversions during their period. Tonight in yoga we did [shoulder stand](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/480).  
If the instructor does not give an alternative pose I usually choose [legs up the wall](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/690). Baxter gave us an alternative option tonight. It was almost like legs up the wall but without the wall. I chose to do that. It felt good. The [bolster](http://www.theyogawarehouse.com/RoundYogaBolsters.asp) is an amazing tool to use during yoga practice.  
In the [Yoga Health Benefits](http://www.yogawiz.com/blog/yoga-practice-during-menstruation/yoga-poses-during-menses.html) article I found: &#8220;According to the traditional Yoga philosophy, menstruation is referred to as ‘apana.’ This refers to a downward flow of energy. Performing an inversion when one is experiencing ‘apana’ is thought to interfere with this natural flow of energy.&#8221; I have heard this before and I tend to follow this philosophy.  
As I was researching for this blog post I found many articles, posts, etc. that said inverting during your period was fine. But all said the individual should decide what is best for her.
