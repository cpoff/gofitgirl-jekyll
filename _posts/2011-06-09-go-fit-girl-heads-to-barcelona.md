In preparation for my trip to Barcelona I have been working pretty hard to eat healthy and exercise regularly to get me in shape for my gorge and drink fest while in Europe.  
For the past 10 days I have exercised. That&#8217;s damn good.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It has been spin or yoga or body conditioning or abs. I am proud of my hard work and plan to not care about what I am eating or drinking while on vacation. Because I am on vacation.

  Not sure how much I will be blogging on Go Fit Girl! I will post if I have something to write about.
