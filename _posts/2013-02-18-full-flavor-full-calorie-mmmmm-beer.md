    My mom and I enjoyed Allagash White Ale at The Trappist in downtown Oakland in July.Â

I used to hate the taste of beer. Probably because it was a Coors or something.  
And I still remember someone telling me that eventually I would get used to the taste and actually like beer.  
When I was in college my friend Robert got me into microbrews. Many nights after our shift at the [Arizona Daily Wildcat](http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu) a group of us would go out for beers.  
That&#8217;s when I really got into trying a variety of beers and what I would refer to as good beer. (I was also drinking a good deal of gin and tonic as well.)  
Curt is a beer drinker. So when we first started dating I had my fair share of beer and that continued.  
We have gone on vacation over beer: Oktoberfest in Munich; Newcastle, England&#8211;OK, that was about football, but I love Newcastle Brown Ale; Prague, London, Barcelona, Dublin&#8211;damn good places to drink beer (and eat some good food as well).  
In my quest to lose weight and keep it off I have experimented with the light beer imbibing. Hey, I can have &#8220;insert number here&#8221; of light beers vs. &#8220;not as high number here&#8221; of regular beers.  
But what I recently decided, I would rather have fewer beers and actually enjoy a good-tasting beer.  
Since I brought up Newcastle, let&#8217;s look at some nutritional information for a 12-ounce beer: Calories: 138; Carbs: 12.8; Alcohol Percentage: 4.7. (All nutritional beer information comes from [Fit Sugar](http://www.fitsugar.com/Calories-Popular-Beers-1504697).)  
I used to regularly drink Corona Light. So let&#8217;s look at Corona: Calories: 148; Carbs: 14; Alcohol Percentage: 4.6. And Corona Light: Calories: 99; Carbs: 5; Alcohol Percentage: 3.2  
Doing a quick look at the beers listed on Fit Sugar, the calorie difference between a regular beer and its light equivalent is about 40-50.  
So yes, light beer has fewer calories and carbs than regular. And in my experience, light beer doesn&#8217;t have as much flavor as a regular beer.  
And for someone who likes to eat and drink I am gonna go for flavor in my beer over a lot less flavor in my beer and just a few less calories. (I&#8217;m finding that having less of something that tastes great is way better than having more of something that doesn&#8217;t taste so great&#8211;such as fat free Ranch dressing vs. regular Ranch dressing.)
