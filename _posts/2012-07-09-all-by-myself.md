    I think working out 100% by myself was successful. Look how sweaty I am in this self-portrait.

The shuttle schedule at work recently changed. The second shuttle switched from leaving South San Francisco at 5:35 to leaving at 6:10. That&#8217;s a huge difference and makes for an even longer day than I already have.  
In the past I would be done with work about 4 and head down to the gym until the 5:35 shuttle arrived. (Or I take the 4:15 shuttle home and hit a 6 p.m. yoga class.)  
But 6:10? That&#8217;s just too late. And that means I would get home around 7:30, possibly later. That doesn&#8217;t work out too well when I have to go to bed between 9:30 and 10 to get up at 5:30. And when I get home I have to shower, make dinner, eat dinner, get gym bag ready for the next day along with work clothes and blog. Whew! Oh, and if I am lucky relax a little with some TV watching, reading or knitting.  
So today for the first time in a long time I headed to the gym and did a workout 100% all by myself. (Cue [Bridget Jones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D0zfB1l1x0). OK, it wasn&#8217;t that dramatic. But that movie and scene crack me up.)  
I prefer classes as they are more motivating for me. Secondary I will ride the spin bike at the work gym where [Josh](http://jtcycle.blogspot.com/), the spinner dude, encourages me along in my ride on [the monitor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxfDAVqSYUg).  
But I am going to have to start motivating myself a day or two a week because of my wacky schedule.  
Today I walked on the [stair climber](http://www.fitnessblowout.com/equipment/stair-climber/7000-pt-stepmill?aff=google&kw=7000+pt+%27certified+remanufactured%27+blue+console+stepmill+stair+climber&searchterm=7000+pt+%27certified+remanufactured%27+blue+console+stepmill+stair+climber&type=Broad&time=20:12&campaign=13729&ph=%7Bwebsitecallmetric%7D&gclid=COq8mteSjrECFYUaQgodKFVgvw) for 20 minutes. (I have been using that machine 10-20 minutes here and there to get my stair climb challenge in with my work wellness program.) It is great cardio and amazing workout for the butt and legs. After the stair climber I did the spin bike for about 30 minutes on my own. I just plugged my tunes in and sprinted and climbed away.  
I did about 10 minutes of stretching and was ready to head home. I was so freakin sweaty. At first driving home I was so hot I had the windows rolled down. Then I got cold and had the heat blasting.
