    The three Comment Contest Tuesday winners got a variety of prizes since there were only comments from three people.

There were just a few responses. But they were all great and I appreciated every single one of them.  
It is so important for us to take care of ourselves while we are taking care of others.  
This [Comment Contest Tuesday](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/12/freefor5/) was part of [December&#8217;s Monthly Challenge](http://gofitgirl.com/2013/12/dec-challenge/). It lasted for a two-week period and had Challengers do and comment on 5 things attempted each day or over the two weeks.  
Brenda mentioned that she wanted to try meditating for 5 minutes each day. Alicia said she was going to take a lunch break at work. Nicole M. is trying to do nothing for a whole 5 minutes. Nicole and her family are going to volunteer 5 times this month, for organizations or events that don’t benefit them personally. One of the volunteer items Nicole and her family are doing is taking canned food donations at [WinterHaven](http://www.winterhavenfestival.org), which essentially is a neighborhood festival of lights in Tucson. Brenda said she would be visiting WinterHaven and bringing 5 cans of food.  
According to the [WinterHaven website](http://www.winterhavenfestival.org/festival-history), in 2012, more than $20,000 and 33,905 pounds of food were donated to the food bank through the Festival.  
Because this is the holiday season, the prizes this month are catered toward charity with a few fun items thrown in. One of my favorite charity gifts are the Charity Choice gift cards. The recipient gets to pick where the money goes from a  large variety of choices. Whatever your passion you should be able to find in the [list of charities available to support](http://www.charitygiftcertificates.org/Charities.aspx).  
Another prize was a gift card toward [DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org), which according to the site is an online charity that makes it easy for anyone to help students in need. Public school teachers post classroom project requests on the site, and you can give any amount to the project that most inspires you. Once a project reaches its funding goal, the materials are shipped to the school.  
Thanks Brenda, Alicia and Nicole for your comments. Feel free to keep your charity gifts or regift them. You each also get a little something for yourselves, non-charity related. Enjoy.  
Merry, Happy, Joyful whatever you celebrate or don&#8217;t this season to all of my readers, friends and supporters.
