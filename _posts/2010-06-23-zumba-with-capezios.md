[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3566" title="photo-8" src="http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/photo-8-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />](http://gofitgirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/photo-8.jpg)A friend (who attends spin and Zumba with me) at the gym gave me her [Capezio dance shoes](http://www.zappos.com/capezio-toggle-black) to use for Zumba. They ended up being too small for her. I thought they might be too big for me. But they seemed to fit and are quite comfy when I tried them on at home. I wore them today for class.  
I was able to move more easily on the hardwood floors with the dance shoes than with regular tennis shoes.  
The photo isn&#8217;t so great. But it was taken at night with my iPhone. But you get the idea. And if you really want to see the shoes you can click on the link above.  
I am still enjoying the Zumba class. I am even thinking of taking the Tuesday noon class. We&#8217;ll see if I can fit that into my schedule.  
Today was my fourth Zumba class. I am getting better at the moves&#8211;but it is still slow. I get lost easily. But I definitely feel more confident. And really if I am out of sync I am just jumping around, having a great time and definitely sweating big time.  
I still love Zumba and think it is an amazing workout &#8230; even if I still look and feel like a dork&#8211;even if Heidi tells me I am doing a great job.
