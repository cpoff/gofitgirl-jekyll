I am not normally a competitive person. (Though get me in a game of Taboo and I get crazy&#8211;but that has nothing to do with health or fitness.)  
Last Wednesday we had a new guy come to yoga. One of those muscular beefy weight lifter dudes. It is always interesting to see those kind of guys come to yoga and be humbled by it. The &#8220;new guy&#8221; was there today and last Wednesday morning. For some reason I felt the need to really push myself last week and show him that someone little like me can do these crazy poses and hold them and make it look fairly easy.  
Normally my attitude is much different in yoga. I find my edge and back off a little. Yoga does not go with the idea of no pain no gain. It is more about listening to your body. That being said I still wouldn&#8217;t do anything that I am not ready for or my body couldn&#8217;t handle.  
But maybe my leg was on fire, shaking and I was ready to get out of the pose&#8211;but I stayed a little longer. Showing off a little. ðŸ™‚
