On Thursday night in yoga while either doing [Lizard pose](http://yoga.about.com/od/yogaposes/a/lizard.htm) or what the teacher funnily called [Screaming Pigeon](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2493) (against the wall) I pulled my [hamstring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring) in my right leg.  
I took a Vinyasa class Friday morning. Most teachers will ask before a class starts if anyone needs to talk to them about anything going on with their body. I mentioned my pulled hamstring and that it happened the night before. She said it was good that the injury just happened, which meant I could easily take care of it. Rachel suggested I back off a pose when I felt strain and in the standing poses to make sure my knee was slightly bent to avoid strain.  
I was careful during that yoga class and I didn&#8217;t cause anymore injury to myself and felt great after the class. I had dinner plans so I wasn&#8217;t able to make my the Forrest Yoga class at 5. I liked Rachel&#8217;s class. I definitely plan on taking it again when my schedule allows it.  
On Saturday during spin I never felt a pull on my hamstring. I did a a few times in abs class, believe it or not. And luckily in body conditioning there was a huge concentration on weights and arms. So we only did a few squat exercises.  
I was careful in my Vinyasa class today as well. There were only a couple of poses I backed off from.  
My hamstring seems almost back to normal. The idea of letting the hamstring heal instead of trying to push through it seemed the best approach to get my minor injury healed quickly.
